<p>The present translation of Dr. E. Warming’s <i>Haandbog i den
Systematiske Botanik</i> is taken from the text of the 3rd Danish
Edition (1892), and from Dr. Knoblauch’s German Edition (1890), and
the book has been further enriched by numerous additional notes which
have been kindly sent to me by the author. Dr. Warming’s work has long
been recognised as an original and important contribution to Systematic
Botanical Literature, and I have only to regret that the pressure
of other scientific duties has delayed its presentation to English
readers. Dr. Warming desires me to record his high appreciation of the
careful translation of Dr. Knoblauch, and his obligation to him for a
number of corrections and improvements of which he has made use in the
3rd Danish Edition. In a few instances I have made slight additions
to the text; these, however, appear as footnotes, or are enclosed in
square brackets.</p>

<p>In the present Edition the Thallophytes have been revised and
rearranged from notes supplied to me by Dr. Knoblauch, to whom I am
indebted for the Classification of the Fungi, according to the more
recent investigations of Brefeld. The Bacteria have been revised by
Dr. Migula, the Florideæ rearranged after Schmitz, and the Taphrinaceæ
after Sadebeck. The main body of the text of the Algæ and Fungi remains
as it was originally written by Dr. Wille and Dr. Rostrup in the Danish
Edition, though in many places considerable alterations and additions
have been made. For the sake of comparison a tabular key to the
Classification adopted in the Danish Edition is given in the Appendix.</p>

<p>In the Angiosperms I have retained the sequence of orders in the Danish
original, and have not rearranged them according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> the systems
more familiar to English students. In any rearrangement much of the
significance of Dr. Warming’s valuable and original observations
would have been lost, and also from a teacher’s point of view I have
found this system of great value. Although at present it may not be
completely satisfactory, yet as an attempt to explain the mutual
relationships, development and retrogression of many of the orders, it
may be considered to have a distinct advantage over the more artificial
systems founded upon Jussieu’s Divisions of Polypetalæ, Gamopetalæ, and
Apetalæ.</p>

<p>With reference to the principles of the systematic arrangement adopted,
I may here insert the following brief communication from the author
(dated March, 1890), which he has requested me to quote from the
preface of Dr. Knoblauch’s edition:&mdash;“Each form which, on comparative
morphological considerations, is clearly less simple, or can be shown
to have arisen by reduction or through abortion of another type having
the same fundamental structure, or in which a further differentiation
and division of labour is found, will be regarded as younger, and
as far as possible, and so far as other considerations will admit,
will be reviewed later than the ‘simpler,’ more complete, or richer
forms. For instance, to serve as an illustration: <span class="smcap">Epigyny</span>
and <span class="smcap">Perigyny</span> are less simple than <span class="smcap">Hypogny</span>; the
Epigynous <i>Sympetalæ</i>, <i>Choripetalæ</i>, <i>Monocotyledones</i>
are, therefore, treated last, the <i>Hydrocharitaceæ</i> are
considered last under the <i>Helobieæ</i>, etc. <span class="smcap">Zygomorphy</span>
is younger than <span class="smcap">Actinomorphy</span>; the <i>Scitamineæ</i> and
<i>Gynandræ</i> therefore follow after the <i>Liliifloræ</i>, the
<i>Scrophulariaceæ</i> after the <i>Solanaceæ</i>, <i>Linaria</i> after
<i>Verbascum</i>, etc. <span class="smcap">Forms with united leaves</span> indicate
younger types than those with free leaves; hence the <i>Sympetalæ</i>
come after the <i>Choripetalæ</i>, the <i>Sileneæ</i> after the
<i>Alsineæ</i>, the <i>Malcaceæ</i> after the <i>Sterculiaceæ</i> and
<i>Tiliaceæ</i>, etc.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Acyclic</span> (spiral-leaved) flowers are older than cyclic
(verticillate-leaved) with a definite number, comparing, of
course, only those with the same fundamental structure. The
<i>Veronica</i>-type must be considered as younger, for example, than
<i>Digitalis</i> and <i>Antirrhinum</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> these again as younger than
<i>Scrophularia</i>; <i>Verbascum</i>, on the contrary, is the least
reduced, and therefore considered as the oldest form. Similarly the
one-seeded, nut-fruited <i>Ranunculaceæ</i> are considered as a later
type (with evident abortion) than the many-seeded, folicular forms of
the Order; the <i>Paronychieæ</i> and <i>Chenopodiaceæ</i> as reduced
forms of the <i>Alsineæ</i> type; and the occurrence of few seeds in
an ovary as generally arising through reduction of the many-seeded
forms. The <i>Cyperaceæ</i> are regarded as a form derived from the
<i>Juncaceæ</i> through reduction, and associated with this, as is
so often the case, there is a complication of the inflorescence; the
<i>Dipsacaceæ</i> are again regarded as a form proceeding from the
<i>Valerianaceæ</i> by a similar reduction, and these in their turn
as an offshoot from the <i>Caprifoliaceæ</i>, etc. Of course these
principles of systematic arrangement could only be applied very
generally; for teaching purposes they have often required modification.”</p>

<p>In preparing the translation considerable difficulty has been
experienced in finding a satisfactory rendering of several terms which
have no exact equivalent in English. I may here especially mention the
term Vorblatt (Forblad) which I have translated by the term bracteole,
when it clearly applied to the first leaf (or leaves) on a pedicel; but
in discussing questions of general morphology a term was much needed
to include both vegetative and floral shoots, and for this I have
employed the term “Fore-leaf.” Also, the term “Floral-leaf” has been
adopted as an equivalent of “Hochblatt,” and the term “bract” has been
limited to a leaf subtending a flower. I have followed Dr. E. L. Mark
in translating the word “Anlage” by “Fundament.”</p>

<p>At the end of the book will be found a short appendix giving an outline
of some of the earlier systems of Classification, with a more complete
account of that of Hooker and Bentham.</p>

<p>In a book of this character it is almost impossible to avoid some
errors, but it is hoped that these will be comparatively few. In
correcting the proof-sheets I have received invaluable assistance
from Dr. Warming and Dr. Knoblauch, who have kindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span> read through
every sheet, and to whom I am greatly indebted for many criticisms
and suggestions. I have also to thank Mr. I. H. Burkill for his kind
assistance in looking over the proofs of the Monocotyledons and
Dicotyledons, and Mr. Harold Wager for kindly reading through the
proofs of the Algæ and Fungi. My thanks are also especially due to Mr.
E. L. Danielsen, and I wish to take this opportunity of acknowledging
the very considerable help which I have received from him in
translating from the Original Danish.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CLASSIFICATION OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Vegetable Kingdom is arranged in 5 Divisions.</p>

<p>Division I.&mdash;<b>Thallophyta</b>, <b>Stemless Plants</b>, or those which
are composed of a “thallus,” <i>i.e.</i> organs of nourishment which
are not differentiated into root (in the sense in which this term is
used among the higher plants), stem, or leaf. Vascular bundles are
wanting. Conjugation and fertilisation in various ways; among most of
the Fungi only vegetative multiplication.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In contradistinction to the Thallophytes all other plants are
called “Stem-plants” (“Cormophyta”), because their shoots are
leaf-bearing stems. The name Thallophyta (Stemless-plants) is
to some extent unsuitable, since many of the higher Algæ are
differentiated into stem and leaf.</p>
</div>

<p>The Thallophytes are again separated into 3 sub-divisions, namely:</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li class="hangingindent1">Sub-Division <b>A.</b>&mdash;<b>Myxomycetes, Slime-Fungi</b>, with only 1 class.</li>
  <li>Sub-Division <b>B.</b>&mdash;<b>Algæ</b>, with 10 classes:</li>
  <li class="i3">Class 1. Syngeneticæ.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;2. Dinoflagellata, Peridinea.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;3. Diatomeæ, Diatoms.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;4. Schizophyta, Fission Algæ.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;5. Conjugatæ.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;6. Chlorophyceæ, Green Algæ.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;7. Characeæ, Stone-worts.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;8. Phæophyceæ, Brown Algæ.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;9. Dictyotales.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&ensp;10. Rhodophyceæ, Red Algæ.</li>
  <li>Sub-Division <b>C.</b>&mdash;<b>Fungi</b>, with 3 classes:</li>
  <li class="i3">Class 1. Phycomycetes.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;2. Mesomycetes.</li>
  <li class="i3">&emsp;„&emsp;3. Mycomycetes, Higher Fungi.</li>
</ul>

<p>Division II.&mdash;<b>Bryophyta or Muscineæ, Mosses.</b> These have
leaf-bearing shoots, but neither true roots nor vascular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> bundles. The
lowest Mosses have, however, a thallus. Fertilisation is accomplished
by means of self-motile, spirally coiled spermatozoids, through the
agency of water. From the fertilised oosphere a “fruit-body” (capsule)
with unicellular organs of reproduction (spores) is produced. The spore
on germination gives rise to the vegetative system, which bears the
organs of sexual reproduction; and this system is divided into two
stages&mdash;the protonema, and the leaf-bearing plant produced on it.</p>

<p>Alternation of generations:</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li class="hangingindent2">&ensp;I. The protonema and the entire nutritive system which
                                     bears the organs of sexual reproduction.</li>
  <li>II. The capsule-like sporangium, with spores.</li>
  <li>&ensp;2 Classes: 1. Hepaticæ, Liverworts.</li>
  <li class="i5">2. Musci, Leafy Mosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Division III.&mdash;<b>Pteridophyta or Vascular Cryptogams</b>, <b>Fern-like
Plants</b> having leaf-bearing shoots, true roots, and vascular bundles
with tracheides and sieve-tubes. Fertilisation as in the Mosses. From
the fertilised oosphere the leaf-bearing shoot arises, which bears
on its leaves the reproductive organs, the spores, in capsule-like
sporangia. From the germination of the spore a small prothallium is
formed, which bears the sexual reproductive organs.</p>

<p>Alternation of generations:</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li class="hangingindent2">&ensp;I. Prothallium with organs of sexual reproduction.</li>
  <li>II. Leaf-bearing shoot with capsule-like sporangia.</li>
  <li>&ensp;3 Classes: 1. Filicinæ, True Ferns.</li>
  <li class="i5">2. Equisetinæ, Horsetails.</li>
  <li class="i5">3. Lycopodinæ, Club-mosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Division IV.&mdash;<b>Gymnospermæ.</b> The vegetative organs are in the
main similar to those in the 3rd Division; special shoots are modified
into flowers for the service of reproduction. From the oosphere, which
is fertilised by means of the pollen-tube, the leaf-bearing plant is
derived; this passes the first period of its life as an embryo in
the seed, and continues its development when the germination of the
seed takes place. The organs corresponding to the spores of the two
preceding Divisions, are called respectively the pollen-grain and
embryo-sac. The pollen-grains are multicellular; i.e. they contain
an indistinct prothallium. In the embryo-sac a prothallium, rich in
reserve material (endosperm),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> with female organs of reproduction, is
developed <span class="allsmcap">BEFORE FERTILISATION</span>. The pollen-grains are carried
by means of the wind to the ovules; these enclose the embryo-sac, and
are situated on the open fruit-leaf (carpel), which has no stigma.</p>

<p>Alternation of generations:</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li>&ensp;I. Prothallium = Endosperm in ovule.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent2">II. Leaf-bearing plant, with flowers which produce the pollen-sac
and ovule.</li>
  <li>&ensp;3 Classes: 1. Cycadeæ.</li>
  <li class="i5">2. Coniferæ.</li>
  <li class="i5">3. Gnetaceæ.</li>
</ul>

<p>Division V.&mdash;<b>Angiospermæ</b>. The members of this group are very
similar to those of Division IV. The ovules are, however, encased in
closed fruit-leaves (ovary), which have a special portion (stigma)
adapted for the reception and germination of the pollen-grains. The
pollen-grains are bicellular, but with only a membrane separating
the two nuclei; they are carried to the stigma by animals (chiefly
insects), by the wind, or by some other means. Endosperm is not formed
till <span class="allsmcap">AFTER FERTILISATION</span>. Alternation of generations in
the main as in the Gymnosperms, but less distinct; while the sexual
generation, the prothallium, with the organs of fertilisation, is also
strongly reduced.</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li class="hangingindent1">2 Classes:<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> 1. Monocotyledones. Embryo with one seed-leaf.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent3">2. Dicotyledones. Embryo with two seed-leaves.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For a long time the vegetable kingdom has been divided
into. <span class="smcap">Cryptogams</span> (so called because their organs
of reproduction remained for some time undiscovered), and
<span class="smcap">Phanerogams</span> or Flowering-plants which have evident
sexual organs.</p>&emsp;

<p>The first three divisions belong to the Cryptogams, and the
third and fourth divisions to the Phanerogams. This arrangement
has no systematic value, but is very convenient in many ways.</p>

<p>The Cryptogams are also known as Spore-plants, since they
multiply by unicellular organs (spores), and the Phanerogams in
contradistinction are called Seed-plants (Spermaphyta), since
they multiply by seeds, multicellular bodies, the most important
part of which is the embryo (a plant in its infancy). Mosses,
Ferns, and Gymnosperms are together known as Archegoniatæ, since
they possess in common a female organ of distinct structure, the
Archegonium.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">DIVISION I.<br />
<span class="subhed">THALLOPHYTA.</span></h2></div>

<p>The thallus in the simplest forms is unicellular; in the majority,
however, it is built up of many cells, which in a few instances are
exactly similar; but generally there is a division of labour, so
that certain cells undertake certain functions and are constructed
accordingly, while others have different work and corresponding
structure. Vessels or similar high anatomical structures are seldom
formed, and the markings on the cell-wall are with few exceptions very
simple. The Myxomycetes occupy quite an isolated position; their organs
of nourishment are naked masses of protoplasm (plasmodia).</p>

<p>As regards the external form, the thallus may be entirely without
special prominences (such as branches, members), but when such are
present they are all essentially alike in their origin and growth,
that is, disregarding the hair-structures which may be developed. A
shoot of a Seaweed or of a Lichen, etc., is essentially the same as any
other part of the plant; only among the highest Algæ (Characeæ, certain
Siphoneæ, <i>Sargassum</i>, and certain Red Seaweeds) do we find the
same differences between the various external organs of the plant body
as between stem and leaf, so that they must be distinguished by these
names.</p>

<p><i>Roots</i> of the same structure and development as in the
Seed-plants are not found, but <i>organs of attachment</i> (rhizoids
and haptera) serve partly the biological functions of the root.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Systematic division of the Thallophytes</span>. To the Thallophytes
belong three sub-divisions&mdash;Slime-Fungi, Algæ, and Fungi. Formerly
the Thallophytes were divided into Algæ, Fungi, and Lichens. But this
last group must be placed among the Fungi, since they are really
Fungi, which live symbiotically with Algæ. The <i>Slime-Fungi</i>
must be separated from the true Fungi as a distinct subdivision. The
<i>Algæ</i> possess a colouring substance, which is generally green,
brown, or red, and by means of which they are able to build up organic
compounds from carbonic acid and water. The Bacteria, especially,
form an exception to the Algæ in this respect; like the Fungi and
Slime-Fungi they have as a rule no such colouring material, but must
have organic carbonaceous food; these plants form no starch, and
need no light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> for their vegetation (most Fungi require light for
fructification). The Myxomycetes, Bacteria, and Fungi derive their
nourishment either as <i>saprophytes</i> from dead animal or vegetable
matter, or as <i>parasites</i> from living animals or plants (hosts),
in which they very often cause disease.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A remark, however, must be made with regard to this division.
Among the higher plants so much stress is not laid upon the
biological relations as to divide them into “green” and
“non-green”; <i>Cuscuta</i> (Dodder), a parasite, is placed
among the Convolvulaceæ, <i>Neottia</i> and <i>Corallorhiza</i>,
saprophytes, belong to the Orchidacere, although they live
like Fungi, yet their relations live as Algæ. In the same
manner there are some colourless parasitic or saprophytic
forms among the Algæ, and stress must be laid upon the fact
that not only the Blue-green Algæ, but also the Bacteria,
which cannot assimilate carbonic-acid, belong to the Algæ
group, Schizophyceæ. The reason for this is that systematic
classifications must be based upon the relationship of form,
development, and reproduction, and from this point of view we
must regard the Bacteria as being the nearer relatives of the
Blue-green Algæ. All the Thallophytes, which are designated
Fungi (when the entire group of Slime-Fungi is left out), form
in some measure a connected series of development which only
in the lower forms (Phycomycetes) is related to the Algæ, and
probably through them has taken its origin from the Algæ;
the higher Fungi have then developed independently from this
beginning. The distinction of colour referred to is therefore
not the only one which separates the Algæ from the Fungi, but it
is almost the only characteristic mark by which we can at once
distinguish the two great sub-divisions of the Thallophytes.</p>

<p>The first forms of life on earth were probably “Protistæ,”
which had assimilating colour material, or in other words, they
were Algæ because they could assimilate purely inorganic food
substances, and there are some among these which belong to the
simplest forms of all plants. Fungi and Slime-Fungi must have
appeared later, because they are dependent on other plants which
assimilate carbon.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
</div>


<h2 class="smaller"><i>Sub-Division I.</i>&mdash;<b>MYXOMYCETES, SLIME-FUNGI.</b></h2>

<p>The Slime-Fungi occupy quite an isolated position in the Vegetable
Kingdom, and are perhaps the most nearly related to the group of
Rhizopods in the Animal Kingdom. They live in and on organic remains,
especially rotten wood or leaves, etc., on the surface of which their
sporangia may be found.</p>

<p>They are organisms without chlorophyll, and in their vegetative
condition are masses of protoplasm without cell-wall
(<i>plasmodia</i>). They multiply by means of <i>spores</i>, which
in the true Slime-Fungi<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> are produced in sporangia, but in some
others<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> free. The spores are round cells (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a> <i>a</i>) which
in all the true Slime-Fungi are surrounded by a cell-wall. The wall
bursts on germination, and the contents float out in the water which
is necessary for germination. They move about with swimming and
hopping motions like swarmspores (<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>), having a cilia
at the front end and provided with a cell-nucleus and a pulsating
vacuole. Later on they become a little less active, and creep about
more slowly, while they continue to alter their form, shooting out
arms in various places and drawing them in again (<i>g</i>, <i>h</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>); in this stage they are called
<i>Myxamœbæ</i>.</p>

<p>The Myxamœba grows whilst taking up nourishment from the material in
which it lives, and multiplies by division. At a later stage a larger
or smaller number of Myxamœbæ may be seen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> coalesce and form large
masses of protoplasm, <i>plasmodia</i>, which in the “Flowers of Tan”
may attain the size of the palm of a hand, or even larger, but in most
others are smaller. The plasmodia are independent, cream-like masses of
protoplasm, often containing grains of carbonate of lime and colouring
matter (the latter yellow in the Flowers of Tan). They creep about in
the decaying matter in which they live, by means of amœboid movements,
internal streamings of the protoplasm continually taking place; finally
they creep out to the surface, and very often attach themselves to
other objects, such as Mosses, and form sporangia (Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>). These are
stalked or sessile and are generally cylindrical (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>), spherical
or pear-shaped (Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>); they rarely attain a larger size than that of
a pin’s head, and are red, brown, white, blue, yellow, etc., with a
very delicate wall. In some genera may be found a “Capillitium” (Fig.
<a href="#fig4">4</a> <i>cp</i>), or network of branched fine strands between the spores.
Flowers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> Tan (<i>Fuligo septica</i>) has a fruit-body composed
of many sporangia (an Æthalium), which has the appearance of flat,
irregular, brown cakes, inside the fragile external layer of which a
loose powder, the spores, is found. It generally occurs on heaps of
tanners’ bark, and appears sometimes in hot-beds in which that material
is used, and is destructive by spreading itself over the young plants
and choking them.</p>

<p>All the motile stages may pass into <i>resting stages</i>, the small
forms only surrounding themselves with a wall, but the large ones at
the same time divide in addition into polyhedral cells. When favourable
conditions arise, the walls dissolve and the whole appears again as a
naked (free-moving) mass of protoplasm.</p>

<p>To the genuine Slime-Fungi belong: <i>Arcyria</i>, <i>Trichia</i>,
<i>Didymium</i>, <i>Physarum</i>, <i>Stemonitis</i>, <i>Lycogala</i>,
<i>Fuligo</i>, <i>Spumaria</i>, <i>Reticularia</i>.</p>

<p>Some genera wanting a sporangium-wall belong to the Slime-Fungi:
<i>Ceratiomyxa</i>, whose fruit-body consists of polygonal plates, each
bearing stalked spores; <i>Dictyostelium</i>, in which the swarm-stage
is wanting and which has stalked spores. <i>Plasmodiophora brassicæ</i>
preys upon the roots of cabbages and other cruciferous plants, causing
large swellings. <i>Pl. alni</i> causes coral-shaped outgrowths on the
roots of the Alder (<i>Alnus</i>). <i>Phytomyxa leguminosarum</i> may
be found in small knobs (tubercles) on the roots of leguminous plants.
It is still uncertain whether it is this Fungus or Bacteria which is
the cause of the formation of these tubercles.</p>


<h2 class="smaller"><i>Sub-Division</i> II.&mdash;<b>ALGÆ</b>.</h2>

<p><b>Mode of Life.</b> The Algæ (except most of the Bacteria) are
themselves able to form their organic material by the splitting up of
the carbonic acid contained in the water, or air in some cases, and for
this purpose need light. The majority live in water, fresh or salt, but
many are present on damp soil, stones, bark of trees, etc.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Bacteria, no saprophytes have actually been
determined to belong to this group, and only very few true parasites
(for instance, <i>Phyllosiphon arisari</i>, <i>Mycoidea</i>, etc.),
but a good many are found epiphytic or endophytic on other Algæ, or
water plants, and on animals (for instance, certain <i>Schizophyceæ</i>
and <i>Protococcoideæ</i>; <i>Trichophilus welckeri</i> in the hairs
of <i>Bradypus</i>, the Sloth), and several species in symbiotic
relation to various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> Fungi (species of Lichen), to Sponges (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Trentepohlia spongiophila</i>, <i>Struvea delicatula</i>), and to
sundry Infusoria and other lower animals as Radiolarias, <i>Hydra</i>,
etc. (the so-called <i>Zoochlorella</i> and <i>Zooxantella</i>, which
are perhaps partly stages in development of various Green and Brown
Algæ).</p>

<p><b>Vegetative Organs.</b> The cells in all the Algæ (excepting certain
reproductive cells) are surrounded by a membrane which (with the
exception of the Bacteria) consists of pure or altered cellulose,
sometimes forming a gelatinous covering, at other times a harder one,
with deposits of chalk or silica formed in it. The cell-nucleus,
which in the Schizophyta is less differentiated, may be one or more
(<i>e.g. Hydrodictyon</i>, <i>Siphoneæ</i>) in each cell.
Excepting in the majority of the Bacteria, <i>colour materials</i> (of
which <i>chlorophyll</i>, or modifications of it, always seems to be
found) occur, which either permeate the whole cytoplasm surrounding
the cell-nucleus, as in most of the coloured Schizophyta, or are
contained in certain specially formed small portions of protoplasm
(chromatophores).</p>

<p>The individual at a certain stage of development consists nearly always
of only one cell; by its division multicellular individuals may arise,
or, if the daughter-cells separate immediately after the division, as
in many of the simplest forms, the individual will, during the whole
course of its existence, consist of only a single cell (unicellular
Algæ). In multicellular individuals the cells may be more or less
firmly connected, and all the cells of the individual may be exactly
alike, or a division of labour may take place, so that certain cells
undertake certain functions, and are constructed accordingly; this
may also occur in parts of the cell in the large unicellular and
multinuclear Algæ (Siphoneæ, p. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>).</p>

<p>The cells in most of the Algæ belong to the <i>parenchymatous</i>
form; these, however, in the course of their growth, may very often
become somewhat oblong; in many Algæ (particularly Fucoideæ and
Florideæ) occur, moreover, <i>hyphæ-like threads</i>, which are very
long, often branched, and are either formed of a single cell, or,
more frequently, of a row of cells, having a well-pronounced apical
growth. The parenchymatous as well as the hyphæ-like cells may, in the
higher Algæ (especially in certain Fucoideæ and Florideæ), be further
differentiated, so that they form well-defined anatomico-physiological
systems of tissue, <i>i.e.</i> assimilating, conducting, storing, and
mechanical.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>the external form</i>, the thallus may present no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
differentiation, as in many unicellular Algæ, or in multicellular Algæ
of the lower order, which are then either equally developed in all
directions (<i>e.g. Pleurococcus</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>), or form flat
cell-plates (<i>Merismopedium</i>) or threads (<i>Oscillaria</i>,
Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>). The first step in the way of differentiation appears as a
difference between apex and base (<i>Rivularia</i>, <i>Porphyra</i>);
but the division of labour may proceed so that differences may arise
between vegetative and reproductive cells (<i>Œdogonium</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig54">54</a>); hairs and organs of attachment (rhizoids and haptera), which
biologically serve as roots, are developed, and even leaves in certain
forms of high order, belonging to different classes (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Caulerpa</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>; <i>Characeæ</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a>; <i>Sargassum</i>,
Fig. <a href="#fig72">72</a>; and many Florideæ).</p>

<p><b>The non-sexual reproduction</b> takes place <i>vegetatively</i>, in
many instances, simply by division into two, and more or less complete
separation of the divisional products (Diatomaceæ, Desmidiaceæ (Fig.
<a href="#fig36">36</a>), many Fission-plants, etc.), or by detached portions of the thallus
(<i>e.g. Caulerpa</i>, <i>Ulva lactuca</i>, etc.; among many
Schizophyceæ, small filaments known as <i>hormogonia</i> are set free),
or <i>asexually</i> by special reproductive cells (<i>spores</i>)
set free from the thallus; these may be either <i>stationary</i>
or <i>motile</i>. The stationary reproductive cells (spores) may
either be devoid of cell-wall (tetraspores of the Florideæ), or may
possess a cell-wall; in the latter case they may be formed directly
from the vegetative cells, generally by the thickening of the walls
(<i>akinetes</i>), or only after a process of re-juvenescence
(<i>aplanospores</i>). Aplanospores, as well as akinetes, may either
germinate immediately or may become resting-cells, which germinate only
after a period of rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The motile asexual reproductive cells</span> are spherical, egg- or
pear-shaped, naked, <i>swarmspores</i> (<i>zoospores</i>), which have
arisen in other cells (<i>zoosporangia</i>), and propel themselves
through the water by means of cilia; or they are <i>Phyto-Amœbæ</i>,
which have no cilia and creep on a substratum by means of pseudopodia.
The cilia, which are formed from the protoplasm (in the Bacteria,
however, from the membrane), are mostly situated at the pointed and
colourless end, which is directed forwards when in motion, and are
1, 2 (Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a> <i>B</i>), 4 or more. Both the cilia in the Brown Algæ
are attached to one side (Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>); they are occasionally situated
in a circle round the front end (<i>Œdogonium</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a> <i>a</i>,
and <i>Derbesia</i>), or are very numerous and situated in pairs
distributed over a large part or nearly the whole of the zoospore
(<i>Vaucheria</i>). Besides being provided with one or more nuclei<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
(<i>Vaucheria</i>), they may also have a red “eye spot” and vacuoles,
which are sometimes pulsating, <i>i.e.</i> they appear and reappear
at certain intervals. The swarmspores move about in the water in
irregular paths, and apparently quite voluntarily, revolving round
their longer axes; but they come to the surface of the water in great
numbers either because of their dependence on light, or driven by
warm currents in the water, or attracted by some passing mass of food
material. The swarmspores germinate, each forming a new plant, as their
movement ceases they surround themselves with a cell-wall, grow, and
then divide; in Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a> <i>b</i>, two may be seen in the condition of
germination, and about to attach themselves by means of the front end,
which has been developed into haptera (see also Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a> <i>B</i>, lowest
figure).</p>

<p><b>The sexual reproduction</b> here, probably in all cases, consists in
the coalescence of two masses of protoplasm, that is, in the fusion of
their nuclei.</p>

  </div>

<p>The simplest and lowest form is termed <b>conjugation</b>, or
<b>isogamous</b> fertilisation, and is characterized by the fact
that the two coalescing cells (termed gametes) are equal, or almost
equal, in shape and size (the female gamete in the <i>Cutleriaceæ</i>,
<i>e.g. Zanardinia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> collaris</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>, is considerably
larger than the male gamete). The cell in which the <i>gametes</i>
are developed is called a <i>gametaugium</i>, and the reproductive
cell formed by their union&mdash;which generally has a thick wall and only
germinates after a short period of rest&mdash;is termed a <i>zygote</i> or
<i>zygospore</i>. The conjugation takes place in two ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the one way the gametes are motile cells
(<i>planogametes</i>, <i>zoogametes</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>), which unite in pairs
during their swarming hither and thither in the water; during this
process they lie side by side (Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a> <i>d</i>), generally at first
touching at the clear anterior end, and after a time they coalesce
and become a motionless <i>zygote</i>, which surrounds itself with
a cell-wall (Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a> <i>e</i>). This form of conjugation is found in
<i>Ulothrix</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a> <i>d</i>), <i>Acetabularia</i>, and other Algæ
(Figs. <a href="#fig45">45</a>, <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <a href="#fig66">66</a>).</p>

into short branches, which lie close together and touch one another,
the wall at the point of contact is then dissolved (Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>). Through
the aperture thus formed, the aplanogametes unite, as in the first
instance, and form a rounded zygote, which immediately surrounds itself
with a cell-wall. Various modifications occur; compare Figs. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <a href="#fig39">39</a>,

<p>The highest form of the sexual reproduction is the <b>Egg- or
Oogamous</b> fertilisation. The two coalescing cells are in the
main unlike each other in form as well as size. The one which is
considered as the male, and is known as the <i>spermatozoid</i>
(<i>antherozoid</i>), developes as a rule in large numbers in each
mother-cell (<i>antheridium</i>); they are often self-motile (except
in the Florideæ, where they are named <i>spermatia</i>), and are
many times smaller than the other kind, the female, which is known
as the <i>egg-cell</i>, (<i>oosphere</i>). The egg-cell is always a
motionless, spherical, primordial cell which can either float about
freely in the water, as in the Fucaceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>), or is surrounded by a
cell-wall (<i>oogonium</i>); generally only one oosphere is to be found
in each oogonium, but several occur in <i>Sphæroplea</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>). The
result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> of the spermatozoid coalescing with the egg-cell is, as in this
case, the formation of a oospore, which generally undergoes a period of
rest before germination (the Florideæ are an exception, a fruit-body,
<i>cystocarp</i>, being produced as the result of coalescence).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An example of fertilisation is afforded by the Alga,
<i>Sphæroplea annulina</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>). The filamentous thallus
is formed of cylindrical cells with many vacuoles (<i>r</i> in
<i>A</i>); some cells develope egg-cells (<i>B</i>), others
spermatozoids (<i>C</i>), the latter in a particularly large
number. The egg-cells are spherical, the spermatozoids of a
club- or elongated pear-shape with two cilia at the front end
(<i>G</i>; <i>E</i> is however a swarmspore). The spermatozoids
escape from their cells through apertures in the wall (<i>o</i>
in <i>C</i>) and enter through similar apertures (<i>o</i> in
<i>B</i>) to the egg-cells. The colourless front end of the
spermatozoid is united at first with the “receptive spot” of the
egg-cell (see <i>F</i>), and afterwards completely coalesces
with it. The result is the formation of a oospore with wart-like
excrescences (<i>D</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>The female (<i>parthenogenesis</i>) or male (<i>androgenesis</i>)
sexual cell may, sometimes without any preceding fertilisation,
form a new individual (<i>e.g. Ulothrix zonata</i>,
<i>Cylindrocapsa</i>, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Systematic division of the Algæ.</b> The Algæ are divided into the
following ten classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Syngeneticæ</span>; 2. <span class="smcap">Dinoflagellata</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Peridinea</span>; 3. <span class="smcap">Diatomaceæ</span>; 4. <span class="smcap">Schizophyta,
Fission-algæ</span>; 5. <span class="smcap">Conjugatæ</span>; 6. <span class="smcap">Chlorophyceæ,
Green-algæ</span>; 7. <span class="smcap">Characeæ, Stone-worts</span>;
8. <span class="smcap">Phæophyceæ</span>; 9. <span class="smcap">Dictyotales</span>; 10.
<span class="smcap">Rhodophyceæ</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the lowest forms of the Algæ, the Syngeneticæ, the
Dinoflagellata, and the unicellular Volvocaceæ (Chlamydomoneæ),
distinct transitional forms are found approaching the animal kingdom,
which can be grouped as animals or plants according to their method of
taking food or other characteristics. Only an artificial boundary can
therefore be drawn between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In the
following pages only those forms which possess <i>chromatophores</i>,
and have <i>no mouth</i>, will be considered as Algæ.</p>


<h3>Class 1. <b>Syngeneticæ.</b></h3>

<p>The individuals are uni- or multicellular, free-swimming or motionless.
The cells (which in the multicellular forms are loosely connected
together, often only by mucilaginous envelopes) are naked or surrounded
by a mucilaginous cell-wall, in which silica is never embedded. They
contain one cell-nucleus, one or more pulsating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> vacuoles, and one to
two band- or plate-like chromatophores with a brown or yellow colour,
and sometimes a pyrenoid.</p>

<p>Reproduction takes place by vegetative division, or asexually by
zoospores, akinetes (or aplanospores?). Sexual reproduction is unknown.
They are all fresh water forms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To this class may perhaps be assigned the recently arranged
and very little known orders of <i>Calcocytaceæ</i>,
<i>Murracytaceæ</i>, <i>Xanthellaceæ</i>, and
<i>Dictyochaceæ</i>, which partly occur in the free condition in
the sea, in the so-called “Plankton,” and partly symbiotic in
various lower marine animals.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Syngeneticæ</i> are closely related to certain forms in the
animal kingdom, as the Flagellatæ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Chrysomonadinaceæ.</b> Individuals, uni- or
multicellular, swimming in free condition, naked or surrounded
by a mucilaginous covering. The cells are generally oval or
elongated, with 2 (rarely only 1) cilia, almost of the same
length, and generally with a red “eye-spot” at their base, and
with 2 (rarely 1 only) band-shaped chromatophores. Reproduction
by the longitudinal division of the individual cells either
during the swarming, or during a resting stage; in the
multicellular forms also by the liberation of one or more cells,
which in the latter case are connected together.</p>

<p>A. Unicellular: <i>Chromulina</i>, <i>Cryptoglena</i>,
<i>Microglena</i>, <i>Nephroselmis</i>.</p>

<p>B. Multicellular: <i>Uroglena</i>, <i>Syncrypta</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig11">11</a>),
<i>Synura</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the unicellular Chrysomonadinaceæ are probably classed
some forms which are only stages in the development of the
multicellular, or of other <i>Syngeneticæ</i>.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Chrysopyxaceæ</b> are unicellular, and differ
mainly from the preceding in being attached either on a
slime-thread (<i>Stylochrysalis</i>), or enclosed in an
envelope (<i>Chrysopyxis</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a>). They have two cilia,
and multiply by longitudinal (<i>Chrysopyxis</i>) or transverse
division, and the swarming of one of the daughter-individuals
(zoospore). Division may also take place in a motionless stage
(<i>palmella-stage</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 3. <b>Dinobryinaceæ.</b> The individuals are originally
attached, uni- or multicellular; each individual cell is
distinctly contractile, and fixed at the bottom of a cup-shaped,
open envelope. Cilia 2, but of unequal length. Asexual
reproduction by zoospores, which are formed by straight or
oblique longitudinal division of the mother-cell, during a
palmella-stage which is produced in the winter aplanospores.
<i>Epipyxis</i>, <i>Dinobryon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>Order 4. <b>Hydruraceæ.</b> The individuals are attached,
without cilia, multicellular, branched, and with apical
growth. The cells are spherical, but in the final stage almost
spindle-shaped, and embedded in large masses of mucilage.
Asexual reproduction by zoospores which are tetrahedric, with 1
cilia, and by resting akinetes. <i>Hydrurus</i> is most common
in mountain brooks.</p>
</div>


<h3>Class 2. <b>Dinoflagellata.</b></h3>

<p>The individuals are of a very variable form, but always unicellular,
and floating about in free condition. The cell is <i>dorsiventral</i>,
<i>bilateral</i>, <i>asymmetric</i> and generally surrounded by a
colourless membrane, which has <i>no silica</i> embedded in it, but
is formed of a substance allied to <i>cellulose</i>. The membrane,
which externally is provided with pores and raised borders, easily
breaks up into irregularly-shaped pieces. In the forms which have
longitudinal and cross furrows, <i>two cilia</i> are fixed where these
cross each other, and project through a cleft in the membrane; one of
these cilia <i>projects freely</i> and is directed longitudinally to
the front or to the rear, the other one <i>stretches crosswise</i>
and lies close to the cell, often in a furrow (cross furrow). The
chromatophores are coloured brown or green and may either be two
parallel (<i>Exuviella</i>), or several radially placed, discs, which
sometimes may coalesce and become a star-shaped chromatophore. The
coloring material (pyrrophyl) consists, in addition to a modification
of chlorophyl, also of <i>phycopyrrin</i> and <i>peridinin</i>;
this colour is sometimes more or less masked by the products of
assimilation which consist of yellow, red or colourless oil (?)
and starch. Cell-nucleus one: in <i>Polydinida</i> several nuclei
are found; contractile vacuoles many, which partly open in the
cilia-cleft (Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a> <i>gs</i>). In some an eye-spot, coloured red by
hæmatochrome, is found. Pyrenoids occur perhaps in <i>Exuviella</i> and
<i>Amphidinium</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The reproduction</span> takes place as far as is known at present,
only by division. This, in many salt water forms, may take place in
the swarming condition, and, in that case, is always parallel to the
longitudinal axis. The daughter-individuals, each of which retains half
of the original shell, sometimes do not separate at once from each
other, and thus chains (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Ceratium</i>) of several
connected individuals may be formed. In others, the division occurs
after the cilia have been thrown off and the cell-contents rounded. The
daughter-cells then adopt entirely new cell-walls. A palmella-stage
(motionless division-stage) sometimes appears to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> take place, and also
aplanospores (?) with one or two horn-like elongations (<i>e.g.</i> in
<i>Peridinium cinctum</i> and <i>P. tabulatum</i>); at germination one,
or after division, two or more, new individuals may be formed.</p>

<p>Sexual reproduction has not been observed with certainty.</p>

<p>The Dinoflagellata move forward or backward, turning round their
longitudinal axes; in their motion they are influenced by the action
of light. The motion possibly may be produced only by the transverse
cilium, which vibrates rapidly; whilst the longitudinal cilium moves
slowly, and is supposed to serve mainly as a steering apparatus. They
live principally in salt water, but also in fresh.</p>

<p>Besides the coloured forms, which are able to make their own organic
compounds by the splitting up of the carbonic acid contained
in the water, there are a few colourless forms (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Gymnodinium spirale</i>), or such as do not possess chromatophores
(<i>Polykrikos</i>); these appear to live saprophytically, and may be
able to absorb solid bodies with which they come in contact.</p>

<p>Dinoflagellata occur in the “Plankton” of the open sea, where they form
together with Diatomaceæ the basis for the animal life. It is known
with certainty that some salt water forms (like the <i>Noctiluca</i>,
which belongs to the animal kingdom and to which they are perhaps
related) produce light, known as phosphorescence.</p>

<p><i>Dinoflagellata</i> (<i>Peridinea</i>, <i>Cilioflagellata</i>)
are allied through their lowest form (<i>Exuviella</i>) to the
Syngeneticæ and especially to the order Chrysomonadinaceæ. They
may be divided into three orders.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Adinida.</b> Without transverse or longitudinal
furrows, but enclosed in two shells, and with two
parallel chromatophores in each cell. <i>Exuviella</i>,
<i>Prorocentrum</i>.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Dinifera.</b> With tranverse and generally
longitudinal furrow. Many radially-placed, disc-formed
chromatophores. The most common genera are&mdash;<i>Ceratium</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>), <i>Peridinium</i>, <i>Glenodinium</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>),
<i>Gymnodinium</i>, <i>Dinophysis</i>.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Polydinida.</b> With several transverse furrows,
no chromatophores, and several cell-nuclei. Only one
genus&mdash;<i>Polykrikos</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>The order <i>Polydinida</i> deviates in a high degree from the
other Dinoflagellata, not only by its many tranverse furrows,
each with its own transverse cilium, and by the absence of
chromatophores, but also in having several cell-nuclei and a
kind of stinging capsule, which otherwise does not occur within
the whole class. It may therefore be questionable whether this
order should really be placed in the vegetable kingdom.</p>
</div>


<h3>Class 3. <b>Diatomeæ.</b></h3>

<p>The individuals&mdash;each known as a <i>frustule</i>&mdash;assume very
various forms and may be unicellular or multicellular, but present
no differentiation; many similar cells may be connected in chains,
embedded in mucilaginous masses, or attached to mucilaginous
stalks. The cells are bilateral or centric, often asymmetrical,
slightly dorsiventral and have no cilia; those living in the free
condition have the power of sliding upon a firm substratum. The cell
contains 1 cell-nucleus and 1–2 plate-shaped or several disc-shaped
chromatophores. The colouring material “<i>Melinophyl</i>” contains,
in addition to a modification of chlorophyl, a brown colouring matter,
<i>diatomin</i>. 1 or 2 pyrenoids sometimes occur. Starch is wanting
and the first product of assimilation appears to be a kind of oil (?).</p>

<p>The cell-walls are <i>impregnated with silica</i> to such a degree that
they are imperishable and are therefore able to contribute in a great
measure to the formation of the earth’s crust. The structure of their
cell-wall is most peculiar and <i>differs from all other plants</i>
(except certain Desmidiaceæ); it does not consist of a single piece
but is made up of two&mdash;the “shells”&mdash;(compare <i>Exuviella</i> and
<i>Prorocentrum</i> among the Dinoflagellata) which are fitted into
each other, one being a little larger than the other and embracing its
edge, like a box with its lid (Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a> <i>B</i>). The two parts which
correspond to the bottom and lid of the box are known as <i>valves</i>.
Along the central line of the valves a longitudinal <i>rib</i> may
often be found, interrupted at its centre by a small cleft (perhaps
homologous with the cilia-cleft of the Dinoflagellata), through which
the protoplasm is enabled to communicate with the exterior (Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>
<i>A</i>). It is principally by reason of the valves, which bear
numerous fine, transverse ribs, striæ or warts, etc. (Figs. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, <a href="#fig15">15</a>,
<a href="#fig17">17</a>), that the Diatomeæ have become so well known and employed as test
objects in microscopical science. When the division takes place, the
two shells are separated a little from each other, and after the
cell-contents have divided into two masses, two new shells are formed,
one fitting into the larger valve, the other one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> into the smaller
valve of the original frustule. The latter cell (frustule) is thus,
upon the whole, smaller than the mother-cell, and as the cells do not
increase in size, some frustules are smaller than the ones from which
they are derived, and thus, by repeated divisions, it follows that
smaller and smaller frustules are produced. This continued diminution
in size is, however, compensated for by the formation, when the cells
have been reduced to a certain minimum, of <i>auxospores</i>, 2–3 times
larger. These may either be formed <i>asexually</i> by the protoplasm
of a cell increasing, rounding off and surrounding itself with a
new wall (<i>e.g. Melosira</i>) or after <i>conjugation</i>,
which may take place with various modifications: 1. Two individuals
unite after the secretion of a quantity of mucilage, and the valves
then commence to separate from each other, on the side which the two
individuals turn towards each other. The protoplasmic bodies now
release themselves from their cell-wall, and each rounds off to form
an ellipsoidal mass; these two protoplasmic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> masses (gametes) coalesce
to form a zygote, the cell-nuclei and chromatophores also fusing
together. The zygote increases in size, and surrounds itself with a
firm, smooth, siliceous wall&mdash;the <i>perizonium</i>. The auxospores,
whichever way they arise, are not resting stages. The germination of
the zygote commences by the protoplasm withdrawing itself slightly from
the cell-wall and constructing first the larger valve, and later on the
smaller one; finally the membrane of the zygote bursts (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Himantidium</i>). 2. The conjugation occurs in a similar manner, but
the protoplasm of the cells divides transversely before conjugation
into two daughter-cells. Those lying opposite one another conjugate
(Fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>) and form two zygotes. The formation of the perizonium, and
germination take place as in the preceding instance (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Epithemia</i>). 3. Two cells place themselves parallel to each
other, and each of the two cell-contents, without coalescing, becomes
an auxospore. The formation of the wall takes place as in the preceding
case. This is found in the Naviculeæ, Cymbelleæ, the Gomphonemeæ
(<i>e.g. Frustulia</i>, <i>Cocconema</i>).</p>

<p>The Diatomaceæ may be found in salt as well as in fresh water
(often in such masses that the colour of the water or mud becomes
yellow or brown; in the same manner the genera <i>Chætoceros</i>,
<i>Rhizosolenia</i>, <i>Coscinodiscus</i>, and several others, form
large slime-masses, “Plankton” on the surface of the sea), on damp soil
and in dust blown by the wind. They occur as fossils in the recent
formations, often in large deposits (siliceous earth, mountain meal),
as in the cement lime in Jutland, the alluvial deposits beneath Berlin,
in clay strata beneath peat bogs, in guano, etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> These accumulations
of fossilized diatoms are used in the manufacture of dynamite and in
various manufactures.</p>

<p>The Diatomaceæ appear nearest to, and must be placed as a group
co-ordinate with the Dinoflagellata, as they doubtless may be supposed
to derive their origin from forms resembling <i>Exuviella</i>, and to
have lost the cilia. The resemblances to the Desmidiaceæ which are
striking in many respects, can only be conceived as analogies, and
cannot be founded upon homologies, and it is therefore impossible to
regard them as proof of genetic relationship. The family contains only
one order.</p>

and always without reticulate markings. The following groups belong to

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>


<h3>Class 4. <b>Schizophyta, Fission-Algæ.</b></h3>

<p>The individuals are 1&mdash;many celled; the thallus consists in many of a
single cell, in others of chains of cells, the cells dividing in only
one definite direction (Figs. <a href="#fig18">18</a>, <a href="#fig21">21</a>). In certain Fission-Algæ the
cell-chain branches (Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>) and a difference between the anterior
and the posterior ends of the chain is marked; in some, the cells may
be united into the form of flat plates by the cell-division taking
place in two directions; and in others into somewhat cubical masses, or
rounded lumps of a less decided form, by the divisions taking place in
three directions; or less defined masses may be formed by the divisions
taking place in all possible directions.</p>

<p>The cell-walls rarely contain cellulose, they often swell considerably
(Figs. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <a href="#fig22">22</a>), and show distinct stratifications, or they are almost
completely changed into a mucilaginous mass in which the protoplasts
are embedded, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Nostoc</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>), and in the
“Zooglœa” stage of the Bacteria (Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>). Sexual reproduction is
wanting. Vegetative reproduction by division and the separation of
the divisional products by the splitting of the cell-wall or its
becoming mucilaginous; among the Nostocaceæ, Lyngbyaceæ, Scytonemaceæ,
etc., “Hormogonia” are found; in <i>Chamæsiphon</i> and others single
reproductive akinetes are formed. Many Fission-Algæ conclude the
growing period by the formation of resting akinetes or aplanospores.</p>

<p>The Schizophyta may be divided into 2 families:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Schizophyceæ.</span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Bacteria.</span></p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Schizophyceæ,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Blue-Green Algæ.</b></h4>

<p>All the Blue-green Algæ are able to assimilate carbon by means of
a colouring material containing chlorophyll (cyanophyll); but the
chlorophyll in this substance is masked by a blue (phycocyan), or
red (phycoerythrin, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Trichodesmium erythræum</i>
in the Red Sea) colouring matter which may be extracted from them
in cold water after death. The colouring matter, in most of them,
permeates the whole of the protoplasm (excepting the cell-nucleus),
but in a few (<i>e.g. Glaucocystis</i>, <i>Phragmonema</i>),
slightly developed chromatophores are to be found. Where the cells are
united into filaments (cell-chains) a differentiation into apex and
base (<i>Rivulariaceæ</i>) may take place, and also between ordinary
vegetative cells and heterocysts; these latter cannot divide, and are
distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> from the ordinary vegetative cells (Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a> <i>h</i>) by
their larger size, yellow colour, and poverty of contents. Branching
sometimes occurs and is either true or spurious.</p>

cell-chain; in one place a cell is drawn out by the movement of
the cell-chain; <i>b</i> the cell-chain has divided into two parts
(“hormongonia”) which commence to separate from each other.</p>
  </div>

<p>The cell-chain in the spurious branching divides into two parts, of
which either one or both grow beyond the place of division (Fig.
<a href="#fig18">18</a>) and often out to both sides (<i>e.g. Scytonema</i>), the
divisions however, always take place transversely to the longitudinal
direction of the cell-chain. In the true branching a cell elongates
in the direction transverse to the cell-chain, and the division
then takes place nearly at right angles to the former direction
(<i>Sirosiphoniaceæ</i>).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig19" style="width: 750px">
     <img

and the formation of new akinetes; <i>f</i> part of a filament with a
heterocyst, and mature resting akinete.</p>
  </div>

<p>Cilia are wanting, but the filaments are sometimes self-motile
(<i>e.g.</i> hormogonia in <i>Nostoc</i>) and many partly turn round
their axes, partly slide forward or backward (<i>Oscillaria</i>).</p>

<p>Reproduction takes place by spores and hormogonia in addition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> to
simple cell-division. Hormogonia are peculiar fragments of a cell-chain
capable of motion, and often exhibit a vigorous motion in the sheath,
until at last they escape and grow into a new individual (Fig. <a href="#fig18">18</a>).
The spores are reproductive akinetes (<i>Chamæsiphon</i>, etc.) or
resting akinetes; these latter arise by the vegetative cells enlarging
and constructing a thick cell-wall (Fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a> <i>e f</i>). On
germination, this cell-wall bursts and the new cell-chain elongates in
the same longitudinal direction as before (Fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a> <i>b c</i>).
Many (<i>e.g. Oscillaria</i>) may however winter in their
ordinary vegetative stage. Aplanospores are wanting.</p>

<p>The Fission-Algæ are very prevalent in fresh water and on damp soil,
less so in salt water; they also often occur in water which abounds in
decaying matter. Some are found in warm springs with a temperature as
high as 50° C.</p>

<p>The Family may be divided into 2 sub-families:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Homocysteæ</span> (heterocysts are wanting): <i>Chroococcaceæ</i>,
<i>Lyngbyaceæ</i> and <i>Chamœsiphonaceæ</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Heterocysteæ</span> (heterocysts present): <i>Nostocaceæ</i>,
<i>Rivulariaceæ</i>, <i>Scytonemaceæ</i> and <i>Sirosiphoniaceæ</i>.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Chroococcaceæ.</b> The individuals are 1&mdash;many-celled,
but all the cells are uniform, united to form plates or irregular
masses, often surrounded by a mucilaginous cell-wall, but never forming
cell-chains. Multiplication by division and sometimes by resting
akinetes, but reproductive akinetes are wanting. <i>Chroococcus</i>,
<i>Aphanocapsa</i>, <i>Glœocapsa</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>), <i>Cœlosphærium</i>,

<p>Some genera are not mucilaginous, <i>e.g. Cylindrospermum</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>). The cell-chains in others, <i>e.g. Nostoc</i>,
wind in between one another and are embedded in large structureless
jelly-like masses, which may attain the size of a plum or even larger
(Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>); sometimes they are found floating in the water, sometimes
attached to other bodies. Other genera as follows: <i>Aphanizomenon</i>
and <i>Anabæna</i> (in lakes and smaller pieces of water);
<i>Nodularia</i> is partly pelagic. Some occur in the intercellular
spaces of higher plants, thus <i>Nostoc</i>-forms are found in
<i>Anthoceros</i>, <i>Blasia</i>, <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Lemna</i>, and

<h4>Family 2. <b>Bacteria.</b><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>

<p>The Bacteria (also known as Schizomycetes, and Fission-Fungi) are the
smallest known organisms, and form a parallel group to the Blue-green
Algæ, but separated from these Algæ by the absence of their colouring
material; chlorophyll is only found in a few Bacteria.</p>

<p>The various forms under which the vegetative condition of the Bacteria
appear, are termed as follows:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Globular forms, cocci</span> (Figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <a href="#fig30">30</a> <i>c</i>): spherical or
ellipsoidal, single cells, which, however, are usually loosely massed
together and generally termed “<i>Micrococci</i>.”</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Rod-like forms</span>: more or less elongated bodies; the shorter
forms have been styled “<i>Bacterium</i>” (in the narrower sense of the
word), and the term “<i>Bacillus</i>” has been applied to longer forms
which are straight and cylindrical (Figs. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <a href="#fig30">30</a> <i>E</i>).</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Thread-like forms</span>: unbranched, long, round filaments,
resembling those of <i>Oscillaria</i>, are possessed by
<i>Leptothrix</i> (very thin, non-granular filaments; Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a> <i>A</i>,
the small filaments) and <i>Beggiatoa</i> (thicker filaments, with
strong, refractile grains or drops of sulphur (Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>); <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>often
self-motile). Branched filaments, with false branching like many
<i>Scytonemaceæ</i>, are found in <i>Cladothrix</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a> <i>B</i>,
<i>G</i>).</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Spiral forms</span>: Rod-like or filamentous bodies, which more or
less strongly resemble a corkscrew with a spiral rising to the left.
In general these are termed <i>Spirilla</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>); very attenuated
spirals, <i>Vibriones</i> (standing next to Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a> <i>M</i>); if
the filaments are slender and flexible with a closely wound spiral,

produced by cellular division in all the three directions of space,
united into globular or ovoid masses (“parcels”) <i>e.g. Sarcina
ventriculi</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <a href="#fig26">26</a>).</p>

<p>All Bacteria are unicellular. In the case of the micrococci this is
self-evident, but in the “rod,” “thread,” and “spiral” Bacteria, very
often numerous cells remain united together and their individual
elements can only be recognised by the use of special reagents.</p>

successive stages of one individual (from 4–10 p.m.); <i>f</i> an
individual of 32 cells.</p>
  </div>

<p>The condition termed “Zooglœa,” which reminds us of <i>Nostoc</i>,
is produced by the cells becoming strongly mucilaginous. A number
of individuals in active division are found embedded in a mass of
mucilage, which either contains only one, or sometimes more, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the above-named forms. The individuals may eventually swarm out and
continue their development in an isolated condition. Such mucilaginous
masses occur especially upon moist vegetables (potatoes, etc.), on
the surface of fluids with decaying raw or cooked materials, etc. The
mucilaginous envelope is thrown into folds when the Bacteria, with
their mucilaginous cell-walls, multiply so rapidly that there is no
more room on the surface of the fluid.</p>

<p>The cells of the Bacteria are constructed like other plant-cells in
so far as their diminutive size has allowed us to observe them. The
cell-wall only exceptionally shows the reactions of cellulose (in
<i>Sarcina</i>, <i>Leuconostoc</i>; also in a Vinegar-bacterium,
<i>Bacterium xylinum</i>); a mucilaginous external layer is always
present. The body of the cell mostly appears to be an uniform
or finely granulated protoplasm. Very few species (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Bacillus virens</i>) contain chlorophyll; others are coloured red
(purple sulphur Bacteria); the majority are colourless. <i>Bacillus
amylobacter</i> shows a reaction of a starch-like material when
treated with iodine before the spore-formation. Some Bacteria
contain sulphur (see p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>). The body, which has been described as a
<i>cell-nucleus</i>, is still of a doubtful nature.</p>

<p>Artificial colourings with aniline dyes (especially methyl-violet,
gentian-violet, methylene-blue, fuchsin, Bismarck-brown and Vesuvin)
play an important part in the investigations of Bacteria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Movement.</span> Many Bacteria are self-motile; the long
filaments of <i>Beggiatoa</i> exhibit movements resembling those
of <i>Oscillaria</i>. In many motile forms the presence of cilia
or flagella has been proved by the use of stains; many forms have
one, others several cilia attached at one or both ends (Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>) or
distributed irregularly over the whole body; the cilia are apparently
elongations of the mucilaginous covering and not, as in the other Algæ
of the protoplasm. In <i>Spirochæte</i> the movement is produced by
the flexibility of the cell itself. Generally speaking, the motion
resembles that of swarm-cells (<i>i.e.</i> rotation round the long axis
and movement in irregular paths); but either end has an equal power of
proceeding forwards.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The swarming motion must not be confounded with the hopping
motion of the very minute particles under the microscope
(Brownian movement).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetative reproduction</span> takes place by continued transverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
division; hence the name “Fission-Fungi” or “Fission-Algæ,” has been
applied to the Bacteria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spores.</span> The spores are probably developed in two ways. In
the <span class="allsmcap">ENDOSPOROUS</span> species (Figs. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, <a href="#fig29">29</a>), the spore arises
as a new cell inside the mother-cell. The spores are strongly
refractile, smaller than the mother-cell, and may be compared to
the aplanospores of other Algæ. In addition to these there are
the <span class="allsmcap">ARTHROSPOROUS</span> species in which the cells, just as in
<i>Nostoc</i> and other Blue-green Algæ, assume the properties of
spores without previously undergoing an endogenous new construction,
and are able to germinate and form new vegetative generations (Fig.
<a href="#fig27">27</a>). The formation of spores very often commences when the vegetative
development begins to be restricted.</p>

<p>The spores germinate as in <i>Nostoc</i> by the bursting of the

<p><span class="smcap">Distribution.</span> Bacteria and their germs capable of development,
are found everywhere, in the air (dust), in surface water, and in
the superficial layers of the soil. The number varies very much in
accordance with the nature of the place, season, etc. They enter,
together with air and food, into healthy animals and occur always in
their alimentary tract.</p>

<p>The functions of life cease on a slight excess of the maximum or
minimum temperature, numbness setting in when either of these limits is
passed. <i>Crenothrix</i>-threads provided with mucilaginous envelopes
may, according to Zopf, sustain a temperature of-10°. Some Bacteria are
said to be able to resist the exposure to as low a temperature as-110°
for a short time. It is not known at what degree of cold the death of
the Bacteria occurs: the greatest degree of heat which the vegetative
cells can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> withstand is about the same as that for other vegetative
plant-cells, namely, about 50–60° C. Certain Bacteria, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>B. thermophilus</i>, grow and thrive vigorously at 70° C. Many
spores, on the contrary, are able to bear far higher temperatures (in
several species a temperature for some duration of above 100°, those
of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, for instance, can withstand for hours a
temperature of 100° in nutrient solutions; the spores remain capable of
development after exposure to a dry heat of 123° C.).</p>

<p>The <i>Desiccation</i> of the air, if prolonged, kills many forms when
in the vegetative condition. The spores however can bear a much longer
period of dryness, some even several years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxygen.</span> Some species cannot live without a supply of free
oxygen (<i>Aerobic</i>), <i>e.g.</i> the Vinegar-bacteria, the
Hay-bacilli, the Anthrax-bacilli, the Cholera-<i>Microspira</i>.
Other species again thrive vigorously without supply of free
oxygen, and are even checked in their development by the admission
of air (<i>Anaerobic</i>), <i>e.g.</i> the butyric acid Bacterium
(<i>Clostridium butyricium</i> = <i>Bacillus amylobacter</i>). A
distinction may be drawn between obligate and facultative aerobics
and obligate and facultative anaerobics. Several Bacteria, producing
fermentation, may grow without the aid of oxygen when they are living
in a solution in which they can produce fermentation; but, if this is
not the case, they can only grow when a supply of oxygen is available.
A great number of the pathogenic Bacteria belong to the facultative
anaerobics.</p>

<p>A luminous Bacterium (<i>Bacillus phosphorescens</i>) which in the
presence of a supply of oxygen gives a bluish-white light, has been
found in sea-water. Phosphorescent Bacteria have frequently been
observed upon decaying sea-fish, as well as on the flesh of other
animals; by transferring the Bacteria from cod fish to beef, etc., the
latter may be made luminous.</p>

<p><i>Organic carbon compounds</i> are indispensable for all Bacteria,
(except, as it appears, for the nitrifying organisms), as they can
only obtain the necessary supplies of <i>carbon</i> from this source.
The supplies of <i>nitrogen</i>, which also they cannot do without,
can be obtained equally as well from organic compounds as from
inorganic salts, such as saltpetre or ammonia-compounds. The various
“ash-constituents” are also essential for their nourishment.</p>

<p>While Moulds and Yeast-Fungi grow best in an acid substratum, the
<i>Bacteria</i>, on the other hand, generally thrive <i>best</i> in a
<i>neutral</i> or slightly <i>alkaline</i> one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>In <i>sterilization</i>, <i>disinfection</i>, and <i>antisepsis</i>,
means are employed by which the Bacteria are killed, or checked in
their development, for instance, by heat (ignition, cooking, hot
vapours, hot air, etc.), or poisons (acids, corrosive sublimate). The
process of preserving articles of food, in which they are boiled and
then hermetically sealed, aims at destroying the Bacteria, or the
spores of those which already may be present in them, and excluding all
others.</p>

<p>As the Bacteria are unable to assimilate carbon from the carbonic acid
of the air, but must obtain it from the carbon-compounds already in
existence in the organic world, they are either <i>saprophytes</i> or
<i>parasites</i>. Some are exclusively either the one or the other,
<i>obligate</i> saprophytes or parasites. But there are transitional
forms among them, some of which are at ordinary times saprophytes,
but may, when occasion offers, complete their development wholly
or partly as parasites&mdash;<i>facultative parasites</i>; others are
generally parasitic, but may also pass certain stages of development as
saprophytes&mdash;<i>facultative saprophytes</i>.</p>

<p>All chlorophyll-free organisms act in a transforming and disturbing
manner on the organic compounds from which they obtain their
nourishment, and while they themselves grow and multiply, they produce,
each after its kind, compounds of a less degree of complexity,
<i>i.e.</i> they produce <i>fermentation</i>, <i>putrefaction</i>,
sometimes the formation of <i>poisons</i>, and in living beings often
<i>disease</i>.</p>

<p>Those organisms which produce fermentation are called <i>ferments</i>;
this word, however, is also employed for similar transformations in
purely chemical materials (inorganic ferments or enzymes). Many organic
(“living”) ferments, among which are Yeast-cells and Bacteria, give
off during their development certain inorganic and soluble ferments
(enzymes) which may produce other transformations without themselves
being changed. Different organisms may produce in the same substratum
different kinds of transformation; alcoholic fermentation may for
instance be produced by different species of Fungi, but in different
proportions, and the same species produces in different substrata,
different transformations (<i>e.g.</i> the Vinegar-bacteria oxydize
diluted alcohol to vinegar, and eventually to carbonic acid and water).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the study of Bacteria it is absolutely necessary to sterilize
the vessels employed in cultivation, the apparatus, and nutrient
solutions, <i>i.e.</i> to free them from Bacteria germs and
also to preserve the cultures from the intrusion of any foreign
germs (“pure-cultures”). A firm, transparent, nutritive medium
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> frequently employed. This may be prepared by adding to
the nutrient solutions (broth) either gelatine, or&mdash;when the
Bacteria are to be cultivated at blood-heat&mdash;serum of sheep’s or
calf’s blood, agar-agar or carragen; serum alone may in itself
serve as a nutrient medium. The so-called “plate-cultures” are
frequently employed, <i>i.e.</i> the germs are isolated by
shaking them with the melted liquid nutrient gelatine, which
is then spread on a glass plate and allowed to coagulate; when
later on the individual germs grow into colonies, these remain
separate in the solid substratum and it is easy to pursue
their further development. Similar plate-cultures may also be
cultivated in test-tubes and on microscopic slides. The slides
and glass plates must be placed in “moist chambers” free from
Bacteria. By sowing a few cells (if possible one) using a fine
platinum wire, pure cultures for further investigation may be
obtained.</p>

<p>In order to prove the relationship between pathogenic Bacteria
and certain diseases, the experimental production of pathogenic
Bacteria by the inoculation of Bacteria from pure cultures into
healthy animals, is very important.</p>
</div>

<p>It has not so far been possible to establish a <i>classification</i>
of the Bacteria, as the life-history of many species, has not yet
been sufficiently investigated.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The opinions of botanists are at
variance, in many cases, about the forms of growth of a particular
kind. Some species are pleomorphic (many-formed) while others possess
only one form.</p>

<p>The following Bacteria are <b>Saprophytes</b>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cladothrix dichotoma</i> is common in stagnant and running water
which is impregnated with organic matter; the cell-chains have false
branching. According to Zopf, <i>Leptothrix ochracea</i> is one of
the forms of this species which, in water containing ferrous iron
(<i>e.g.</i> as FeCO<sub>3</sub>), regularly embeds ferric-oxide in its sheath
by means of the activity of the protoplasm. <i>Leptothrix ochracea</i>
and other Iron-bacteria, according to Winogradsky (1888), do not
continue their growth in water free from protoxide of iron; while
they multiply enormously in water which contains this salt of iron.
The large masses of ochre-coloured slime, found in meadows, bogs, and
lakes, are probably due to the activity of the Iron-bacteria.</p>

<p>Those forms which, according to Zopf’s views, represent the forms of
development of <i>Cladothrix dichotoma</i> are placed together in
Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>. A represents a group of plants, seventy times magnified,
attached to a Vaucheria. The largest one is branched like a tree,

in the zooglœa-stage, at the base they are elongating to form rods
and <i>Leptothrix</i>-filaments. <i>L</i> a portion of a branched
<i>Cladothrix</i>, which divides into motile <i>Bacillus</i>-forms; the

in the water. <i>M</i> a spirally-twisted, swarming filament, before
and after division into halves. <i>N</i> part of a tree-like zooglœa
with Cocci and short rods.&mdash;All of these spirilla, zooglœa, etc.,
which Zopf has connected with <i>Clad. dichotoma</i>, are according to
Winogradsky, independent organisms.</p>

<p><i>Micrococcus ureæ</i> produces <i>urinal fermentation</i>
(transformation of urinal matter into ammonium carbonate); aerobic;
round cells generally united to form bent chains or a zooglœa.&mdash;Several
other kinds of Bacteria have the same action as this one: in damp soil
containing ammonia-compounds, <i>saltpetre-formations</i> are produced
by <i>M. nitrificans</i> and several different kinds of Bacteria.</p>

<p><i>Micrococcus prodigiosus</i> is found on articles of food containing
starch; “bleeding bread” is caused by this Bacterium, which has the
power of forming a red pigment; it also occurs in milk, and produces
lactic acid.</p>

<p><i>Leuconostoc mesenterioides</i> is the frog-spawn Bacterium (Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>)
which is found in sugar manufactories, and has the power of producing
a viscous fermentation in saccharine solutions which have been derived
from plants, <i>e.g.</i> in beetroot-sugar manufactories, where large
accumulations of mucilage are formed at the expense of the sugar, with
an evolution of carbonic acid. The cell-rows, resembling somewhat a
pearl necklace, have thick mucilaginous cell-walls, and form white
“Nostoc”-lumps. The mucilage eventually deliquesces and the cells
separate from each other; arthrospores?&mdash;Similar viscous deteriorations
occur in beer and wine, which may then be drawn out into long, string
like filaments&mdash;“ropiness.”</p>

<p><i>Bacterium aceti</i>, the Vinegar-bacterium, oxidizes alcohol into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
acetic acid (acetous-fermentation) and forms a greyish covering of
Bacteria (“Vinegar-mother”) on the surface of the liquid; the acetic
acid formed, becomes by continued oxidization by <i>B. aceti</i>, again
transformed into carbonic acid and water. Aerobic; short cylindrical
cells, often united into chains, or to form a zooglœa; sometimes also
rod-and spindle-shaped. The Vinegar-bacteria and other kinds with
ball- or rod-forms sometimes become swollen, spindle-shaped, or oval
links; they are supposed to be diseased forms<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (“Involution-forms”).</p>

<p><i>Bacillus lacticus</i> (<i>Bacterium acidi lactici</i>, Zopf) is
always found in milk which has stood for some time, and in sour foods
(cabbage, cucumbers, etc.); it turns the milk sour by producing lactic
acid fermentation in the sugar contained in the milk; the lactic acid
formed, eventually causes the coagulation of the casein. It resembles
the Vinegar-bacteria, occurring as small cylindrical cells, rarely in
short rows; not self-motile.&mdash;Several other Bacteria appear to act in
the same way, some occurring in the mouth of human beings; some of
these Bacteria give to butter its taste and flavour.</p>

<p>The <i>kefir-grains</i> which are added to milk for the preparation of
kefir, contain in large numbers a Bacterium (<i>Dispora caucasica</i>)
in the zooglœa-form, a Yeast-fungus, and <i>Bacillus lacticus</i>.
Kefir is a somewhat alcoholic sour milk, rich in carbonic acid; it is
a beverage manufactured by the inhabitants of the Caucasus, from the
milk of cows, goats, or sheep, and is sometimes used as a medicine. In
the production of kefir, lactic acid fermentation takes place in one
part of the sugar contained in the milk, and alcoholic fermentation
in another part, and the casein which had become curdled is partially
liquefied (peptonised) by an enzyme of a Zooglœa-bacterium.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus amylobacter</i> (<i>Bacillus butyricus</i>), the
Butyric-acid-bacterium (Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>), is a very common anaerobic which
produces fermentation in sugar and lactic-acid salts, and whose
principal product is <i>butyric acid</i>. It destroys articles of
food and (together with other species) plays a part in the butyric
acid fermentation which is necessary in the making of cheese; it is
very active wherever portions of plants are decaying, in destroying
the cellulose in the cell-walls of herbaceous plants, and is thus
useful in the preparation of flax and hemp. The cells are self-motile,
generally cylindrical, sometimes united into short rows; endosporous;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the spore-forming cells swell, assume very different forms, and show
granulose reaction. The germ-tube grows out in the direction of the
long axis of the spore.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, the Hay-bacillus, is developed in all
decoctions of hay; a slender, aerobic, self-motile Bacillus;
endosporous (aplanospores); the spore-wall ruptures transversely on
germination.</p>

<p><i>Crenothrix kuehniana</i> occurs in the springs of many baths, in
wells, in water or drain-pipes.</p>

  </div>

<p><i>Beggiatoa</i> (parallel with the Blue-green Alga <i>Oscillaria</i>).
Long filaments formed of cylindrical cells which are attached by
one of the ends, but which are nearly always free when observed.
The filaments, like those of <i>Oscillaria</i>, describe conical
figures in their revolutions, the free filaments slide upwards and
parallel with one another; sheaths are wanting; strongly refractive
sulphur drops are found in the interior. The Beggiatoas are the most
prevalent <i>Sulphur-bacteria</i>. They occur, very commonly in large
numbers, wherever plant or animal remains are decaying in water in
which sulphuretted hydrogen is being formed; thus, for example, <i>B.
alba</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>) occurs frequently as a white covering or slimy
film on mud containing organic remains. <span class="smaller"><i>B. mirabilis</i> is
remarkable for its size and its strong peristaltic movements.</span> The
Sulphur-bacteria oxidize the sulphuretted hydrogen, and accumulate
sulphur in the shape of small granules of soft amorphic sulphur, which
in the living cell never passes over into the crystalline state. They
next oxidize this sulphur into sulphuric acid, which is immediately
rendered neutral by absorbed salts of calcium, and is given off in
the form of a sulphate, thus CaCO<sub>3</sub> is principally changed into
CaSO<sub>4</sub>. In the absence of sulphur the nutritive processes are
suspended, and consequently death occurs either sooner or later. The
Sulphur-bacteria may exist and multiply in a fluid which only contains
traces of organic matter, in which organisms devoid of chlorophyll are
not able to exist. The Beggiatoas very frequently form white, bulky
masses in sulphur wells and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> in salt water, the traces of organic
material which the sulphur water contains proving sufficient for them.
<span class="smaller">The cellulose-fermentation, to which the sulphur wells in all
probability owe their origin, mainly procures them suitable conditions
for existence. The CaCO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S, formed during the cellulose
fermentation by the reduction of CaSO<sub>4</sub> is again changed into
CaSO<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> by the Sulphur-bacteria (Winogradsky, 1887).&mdash;Other
Sulphur-bacteria, the so-called purple Sulphur-bacteria, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>B. roseo-persicina</i>, <i>Spirillum sanguineum</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>),
<i>Bacterium sulfuratum</i>, etc., have their protoplasm mixed with a
red colouring matter (bacterio-purpurin) which, like chlorophyll, has
the power, in the presence of light, of giving off oxygen (as proved
by T. W. Englemann, 1888, in oxygen-sensitive Bacteria). The three
purple Sulphur-bacteria mentioned, are, according to Winogradsky, not
pleomorphic kinds but embrace numerous species.</span></p>

<p>Many <i>Spirilli</i> (<i>Spirillum tenue</i>, <i>S. undula</i>, <i>S.
plicatile</i>, and others) are found prevalent in decaying liquids.</p>

<p>Bacteria (especially Bacilli) are the cause of many substances emitting
a foul odour, and of various changes in milk.</p>

<p><b>Parasitic Bacteria</b> live in other living organisms; but the
relation between “host” and parasite may vary in considerable
degree. Some parasites do no injury to their host, others produce
dangerous contagious diseases; some choose only a special kind as
host, others again live equally well in many different ones. There
are further specific and individual differences with regard to the
<i>predisposition</i> of the host, and every individual has not the
same receptivity at all times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The harmless parasites of human beings.</span> Several of the above
mentioned saprophytes may also occur in the alimentary canal of human
beings; <i>e.g.</i>, the Hay-bacillus, the Butyric-acid-bacillus,
etc.; but the gastric juice prevents the development of others, at
all events in their vegetative condition. <i>Sarcina ventriculi</i>,
“packet-bacterium,” is only known to occur in the stomach and
intestines of human beings, and makes its appearance in certain
diseases of the stomach (dilation of the stomach, etc.) in great
numbers, without, however, being the cause of the disease. It occurs in
somewhat cubical masses of roundish cells (Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Less dangerous parasites.</span> In the mouth, especially between
and on the teeth, a great many Bacteria are to be found (more than
fifty species are known), <i>e.g. Leptothrix buccalis</i> (long,
brittle, very thin filaments which are united into bundles), Micrococci
in large lumps, <i>Spirochæte cohnii</i>, etc. Some of them are known
to be injurious, as they contribute in various ways to the decay of
the teeth (<i>caries dentium</i>); a <i>Micrococcus</i>, for instance,
forms lactic acid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> in materials containing sugar and starch, and the
acid dissolves the lime salts in the external layers of the teeth:
those parts of the teeth thus deprived of lime are attacked by other
Bacteria, and become dissolved. Inflammation in the tissues at the root
of a tooth, is probably produced by septic materials which have been
formed by Bacteria in the root-canal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dangerous Parasites.</span> In a large number of the infectious
diseases of human beings and animals, it has been possible to prove
that parasitic Bacteria have been the cause of the disease. Various
pathogenic Bacteria of this nature, belonging to the coccus, rod, and
spiral Bacteria groups, are mentioned in the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Pathogenic Micrococci.</b> <i>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</i>
produces abscesses of various natures (boils, suppurative processes in
internal organs). The same effects are produced by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, which is the most frequent cause of
malignant puerperal fever; it is perhaps identical with&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Streptococcus erysipelatis</i>, which is the cause of erysipelas in
human beings.</p>

<p><i>Diplococcus pneumoniæ</i> (A. Fränkel) is the cause of pneumonia,
and of the epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis.</p>

<p><i>Gonococcus</i> (Neisser) is the cause of gonorrhea and inflammation
of the eyes.</p>

<p><b>Pathogenic Rod-Bacteria.</b> <i>Bacterium choleræ gallinarum</i>,
an aerobic, facultative parasite which produces fowl-cholera among
poultry; it is easily cultivated on various substrata as a saprophyte.
The disease may be conveyed both through wounds and by food, and may
also be communicated to mammals.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, the <i>Anthrax bacillus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig32">32</a>),
chiefly attacks mammals, especially herbivorous animals (house mice,
guinea-pigs, rabbits, sheep, cattle), in a less degree omnivorous
animals (including human beings), and in a still less degree the
Carnivores. Aerobic. Cylindrical cells, 3–4 times as long as broad,
united into long rod-like bodies, which may elongate into long, bent,
and twisted filaments. Not self-motile. Endosporous. Germination
takes place without the throwing off of any spore-membrane (compare
Hay-bacillus p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a> which resembles it). Contagion may take place
both by introduction into wounds, and from the mucous membrane of
the intestines or lungs, both by vegetative cells and by spores; in
intestinal anthrax, however, only by spores. The Bacillus multiplies as
soon as it has entered the blood, and the anthrax disease commences.
The Bacilli not only give off poison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> but also deprive the blood
of its oxygen. Vegetative cells only occur in living animals. This
species is a <i>facultative parasite</i> which in the first stage is a
saprophyte, and only in this condition forms spores.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus tuberculosis</i> produces tuberculosis in human beings,
also in domestic animals (<i>perlsucht</i>). It is a distinct parasite,
but may also live saprophytically. It is rod-formed, often slightly
bent, and is recognised principally by its action with stains (when
stained with an alkaline solution of methyl-blue or carbolic fuchsin,
it retains the colour for a long time even in solutions of mineral
acids, in contrast with the majority of well-known Bacteria): it
probably forms spores which are able to resist heat, dryness, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Bacillus lepræ</i> produces leprosy; <i>Bacillus mallei</i>
produces glanders; <i>Bacillus tetani</i>, tetanus (the tetanus
bacillus is very common in soil; anaerobic); <i>Bacillus
diphtheriæ</i>, diphtheria; <i>Bacillus typhosus</i>, typhoid
fever, etc.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Pathogenic Spiral Bacteria.</b> <i>Spirochæte obermeieri</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig24">24</a>) produces intermittent fever (febris recurrens); it makes its
appearance in the blood during the attacks of fever, but it is not to
be found during intervals when there is no fever. Obligate parasite.</p>

<p><i>Spirillum choleræ asiaticæ</i> (<i>Microspira comma</i>) without
doubt produces Asiatic cholera; an exceedingly motile spirillum, which
is also found in short, bent rods (known as the “Comma-bacillus”),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> it
lives in the intestines of those attacked by the disease, and gives off
a strong poison which enters the body. It is easily cultivated as a
saprophyte.</p>

<p>A great many circumstances seem to show that a number of other
infectious diseases (syphilis, small-pox, scarlet-fever, measles,
yellow-fever, etc.) owe their origin to parasitic Bacteria, but this
has not been proved with certainty in all cases.</p>

<p>It has been possible by means of special cultivations (ample supply
of oxygen, high temperature, antiseptic materials) to produce from
the parasitic Bacteria described above (<i>e.g.</i> the fowl-cholera
and the anthrax Bacteria) <i>physiological varieties</i> which are
distinct from those appearing in nature and possess a less degree of
“virulence,” <i>i.e.</i> produce fever and less dangerous symptoms
in those animals which are inoculated with them. The production
of such physiological varieties has come to be of great practical
importance from the fact that they are used as vaccines, <i>i.e.</i>
these harmless species produce in the animals inoculated with them
<i>immunity</i> from the malignant infectious Bacteria from which
they were derived. This immunity is effected by the change of the
products of one or more of the Bacteria, but we do not yet know
anything about the way in which they act on the animal organism. The
white blood corpuscles, according to the Metschnikoff, play the part
of “Phagocytes” by absorbing and destroying the less virulent Bacteria
which have entered the blood, and by so doing they are gradually
enabled to overcome those of a more virulent nature.</p>

<h3>Class 5. <b>Conjugatæ.</b></h3>

<p>The Algæ belonging to this class have chlorophyll, and pyrenoids
round which starch is formed. The cells divide only in one direction,
they live solitarily, or united to form filaments which generally
float freely (seldom attached). Swarm-cells are wanting. <i>The
fertilisation is isogamous (conjugation) and takes place by means
of aplanogametes.</i> The zygote, after a period of rest, produces,
immediately on germination, one or more new vegetative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> individuals;
sometimes akinetes or aplanospores are formed in addition. They only
occur in fresh or slightly brackish water.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Desmidiaceæ.</b> The cells generally present markings on
the outer wall, and are mostly divided into two symmetrical halves by a
constriction in the middle, or there is at least a symmetrical division
of the protoplasmic cell-contents. The cell-wall consists nearly always
of two layers, the one overlapping the other (Fig. <a href="#fig35">35</a> <i>C</i>). The
cells either live solitarily or are united into unbranched filaments.
The mass of protoplasm formed by the fusion of the two conjugating
cells becomes the zygote, which on germination produces one (or after
division 2, 4 or 8) new vegetative individual. The chromatophores are
either star-, plate-, or band-shaped, and regularly arranged round the
long axis of the cell.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig35" style="width: 550px">
     <img

    src="images/fig35.jpg"

with pores containing protoplasmic projections. <i>C</i> Cell-wall of
<i>Hyalotheca mucosa</i> during cell-division: the central part, being
already formed, shows the connection with the divisional wall.</p>
  </div>

<p>The Desmidiaceæ are not able to swim independently, many species,
however, show movements of different kinds by rising and sliding
forward on the substratum. These movements, which are partly dependent
upon, and partly independent of light and the force of gravitation, are
connected with the protrusion of a mucilaginous stalk. The mucilage,
which sometimes surrounds the whole individual, may acquire a prismatic
structure, it is secreted by the protoplasmic threads which project
through certain pores definitely situated in the walls (Fig. <a href="#fig35">35</a>
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetative multiplication</span> takes places by division. A good
example of this is found in <i>Cosmarium botrytis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>
<i>A-D</i>). The nucleus and chromatophores divide, and simultaneously
the central indentation becomes deeper, the outer wall is then ruptured
making a circular aperture through which the inner wall protrudes
forming a short, cylindrical canal between the two halves to which it
is attached (Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a> <i>C</i>). After elongation the canal is divided
by a central transverse wall, which commences as a ring round its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
inner surface and gradually forms a complete septum. The dividing wall
gradually splits, and the two individuals separate from each other,
each one having an old and a new half. The two daughter-cells bulge
out, receive a supply of contents from the parent-cells, and gradually
attain their mature size and development (Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a> <i>B-D</i>).
Exceptions to this occur in some forms.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjugation</span> takes place in the simplest way in
<i>Mesotænium</i>, where the two conjugating cells unite by a short
tube (conjugation-canal), which is not developed at any particular
point. The aplanogametes merge together after the dissolution of the
dividing wall, like two drops of water, almost without any trace of
preceding contraction, so that the cell-wall of the zygote generally
lies in close contact with the conjugating cells. The conjugating cells
in the others lie either transversely (<i>e.g. Cosmarium</i>,
Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> <i>d</i>; <i>Staurastrum</i>, etc.), or parallel to one
another (<i>e.g. Penium</i>, <i>Closterium</i>, etc.), and
emit a short conjugation-canal (Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> <i>d</i>) from the centre of
that side of each cell which is turned towards the other one. These
canals touch, become spherical, and on the absorption of the dividing
wall the aplanogametes coalesce in the swollen conjugation-canal
(Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> <i>e</i>), which is often surrounded by a mucilaginous
envelope. The zygote, which is often spherical, is surrounded by a
thick cell-wall, consisting of three layers; the outermost of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
sometimes bears thorn-like projections, which in some species are
simple (Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> <i>f</i>), in others branched or variously marked; in
some, however, it remains always smooth (<i>e.g. Tetmemorus</i>,
<i>Desmidium</i>). Deviation from this mode of conjugation may occur
within certain genera (<i>e.g. Closterium</i>, <i>Penium</i>).
Upon germination the contents of the zygote emerge, surrounded by
the innermost layers of the wall (Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>) and
generally divide into two parts which develop into two new individuals,
placed transversely to each other (Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> <i>i</i>); these may have a
somewhat more simple marking than is generally possessed by the species.</p>

  </div>

<p>The conjugation among the Zygnemaceæ takes place in the following
manner: the cells of two filaments, lying side by side, or two cells,
the one being situated above the other in the same filament (Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>),
push out small protuberances opposite each other (Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a> <i>A</i>,
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>); these finally meet, and the dividing wall is
absorbed so that a tube is formed connecting one cell with the other;
the protoplasmic contents round off, and the whole of these contents
of one of the cells glides through the conjugation-tube and coalesces
with that of the other (Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a> <i>B</i>), the aggregate mass then
rounds off, surrounds itself with a cell-wall, and becomes a zygote.
A distinct difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> may be found between the cells in the two
filaments, those in the one whose protoplasmic contents pass over being
cylindrical, while those of the recipient one are more barrel-shaped,
and of a larger diameter. The former may be regarded as a male, the
latter as a female plant. The zygote germinates after a period of rest,
and grows out into a new filament (Fig. <a href="#fig42">42</a>).</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Mesocarpaceæ.</b> The cell-walls are glabrous,
unconstricted in the centre, and united into simple unbranched
filaments. The chromatophore consists of an axial chlorophyll-plate,
with several pyrenoids. The zygote is formed by the coalescence
of two cells (Fig. <a href="#fig43">43</a>) (sometimes three or four), but the whole
protoplasmic contents of the cells do not take part in this process,
a portion always remaining behind; the aplanogametes coalesce in
the conjugation-canal. The zygote thus formed appears incapable of
germination until after 3–5 divisions. Of the cells so formed, only one
is fertile, the sterile cells, according to Pringsheim, constituting
a rudimentary sporocarp. The germinating cells grow out into a new
filament. In this order, conjugation has been observed between two
cells of the same filament. The Mesocarpaceæ thrive best in water which
contains lime.</p>

<h3>Class 6. <b>Chlorophyceæ (Green Algæ).</b></h3>

<p>These Algæ are coloured green by chlorophyll, seldom in combination
with other colouring matter, and then especially with red. The product
of assimilation is frequently starch, which generally accumulates round
certain specially formed portions of protoplasm termed pyrenoids.
The thallus is uni- or multicellular; in the higher forms (certain
Siphoneæ) the organs of vegetation attain differentiation into stem
and leaf. The asexual reproduction takes place in various ways; the
sexual reproduction is effected by conjugation of motile gametes, or
by oogamous fertilisation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> swarm-cells (zoospores, gametes, and
spermatozoids) are constructed symetrically, and have true protoplasmic
cilia, these generally being attached to the front end of the
swarm-cells. Most of these Algæ live in water (fresh or salt); some are
found upon damp soil, stones, or tree-stems, and some live enclosed in
other plants.</p>

<p>The Class is divided into three families:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Protococcoideæ</span>: Volvocaceæ, Tetrasporaceæ, Chlorosphæraceæ,
Pleurococcaceæ, Protococcaceæ, Hydrodictyaceæ.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Confervoideæ</span>: Ulvaceæ, Ulothricaceæ, Chætophoraceæ,
Mycoideaceæ, Cylindrocapsaceæ, Œdogoniaceæ, Coleochætaceæ,
Cladophoraceæ, Gomontiaceæ, Sphæropleaceæ.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Siphoneæ</span>: Botrydiaceæ, Bryopsidaceæ, Derbesiaceæ,
Vaucheriaceæ, Phyllosiphonaceæ, Caulerpaceæ, Codiaceæ, Valoniaceæ,
Dasycladaceæ.</p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Protococcoideæ.</b></h4>

<p>The Algæ which belong to this group are uni- or multicellular with
the cells more or less firmly connected, sometimes in a definite,
sometimes in an indefinite form (Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>). Colonies are formed either
by division or by small unicellular individuals becoming united in a
definite manner; the colonies formed in this latter way are termed
<i>Cœnobia</i>. Apical cells and branching are absent. Multiplication
by division; asexual reproduction by zoospores, rarely by akinetes.
Sexual reproduction may be wanting, or it takes place by isogamous,
rarely by oogamous fertilisation.</p>

<p>Some are attached by means of a stalk to other objects
(<i>Characium</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig49">49</a>), others occur as “Endophytes” in the
tissues of certain Mosses or Phanerogams, <i>e.g. Chlorochytrium
lemnæ</i>, in <i>Lemna trisulca</i>; <i>Endosphæra</i>, in the
leaves of <i>Potamogeton</i>, <i>Mentha aquatica</i>, and <i>Peplis
portula</i>; <i>Phyllobium</i>, in the leaves of <i>Lysimachia
nummularia</i>, <i>Ajuga</i>, <i>Chlora</i>, and species of Grasses;
<i>Scotinosphæra</i> in the leaves of <i>Hypnum</i> and <i>Lemna
trisulca</i>; the majority, however, live free in water and in damp
places. Many species which were formerly considered to belong to this
family have been proved to be higher Algæ in stages of development.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Volvocaceæ.</b> The individuals in this order are either
uni- or multicellular, and during the essential part of their life are
free-swimming organisms. They are generally encased in a mucilaginous
envelope, through which 2–6 cilia project from every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> cell. The
vegetative reproduction takes place by the division of all, or a few,
of the cells of the individual; in some a palmella-stage is found in
addition. The sexual reproduction takes place by isogamous or oogamous
fertilisation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Volvocaceæ may be considered to include the original forms
of the Chlorophyceæ, because, among other reasons, the motile
stage is here the most prominent; they also form the connecting
link between the animal Flagellata, and forms intermediate to
the <i>Syngeneticæ</i> may perhaps be found amongst them. Three
series of green Algæ may be supposed to have taken their origin
from the Volvocaceæ: <span class="smcap">Conjugateæ</span> (<i>Desmidiaceæ</i>)
which have lost the swarming stage, but whose conjugation
is the nearest to the fertilisation in <i>Chlamydomonas
pulvisculus</i>: the <span class="smcap">Protococcaceæ</span> in which the
vegetative divisions have disappeared, while the swarming
stage continues to be present, though of shorter duration; and
<span class="smcap">Tetrasporaceæ</span>, in which the vegetative divisions are
more prominent, whilst the swarming stage is less so.</p>
</div>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">Unicellular Individuals.</span> The principle genera are:
<i>Chlamydomonas</i>, <i>Sphærella</i>, <i>Phacotus</i>.&mdash;<i>Sphærella
nivalis</i> is the Alga which produces the phenomenon of “Red Snow,”
well known on high mountains and on ice and snow fields in the polar
regions. The red colouring matter which appears in this and other green
Algæ, especially in the resting cells, is produced by the alteration of
the chlorophyll.</p>

<p><i>Phacotus lenticularis</i> has an outer covering incrusted with
lime, which, at death, or after division, opens out into two halves.
Species may be found among <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, in which conjugation
takes place between gametes of similar size without cell-wall, but in
<i>C. pulvisculus</i> conjugation takes place between male and female
aplanogametes which are surrounded by a mucilaginous envelope.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Multicellular Individuals.</span> The most important genera
are <i>Gonium</i>, <i>Stephanosphæra</i>, <i>Pandorina</i>,
<i>Eudorina</i>, <i>Volvox</i>.&mdash;<i>Gonium</i> has 4 or 16
cells arranged in a definite pattern in a flat plate (Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>).
<i>Pandorina</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>), has 16 cells arranged in a sphere (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>
<i>A</i>). The vegetative reproduction takes place in this way: each
cell, after having rounded off, and after the withdrawal of the cilia,
divides itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> into 16 new ones (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>B</i>), each forming a
new individual, which soon grows to the size of the mother-individual.
It was in this Alga that the conjugation of self-motile gametes was
first discovered by Pringsheim, 1869. When conjugation is about to take
place, each cell divides into sixteen, as in vegetative reproduction,
but the 16 × 16 cells all separate from one another (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>C</i>,
female gametes, and <i>D</i>, male gametes), and swarm solitarily in
the water. The male are, most frequently, smaller than the female, but
otherwise they are exactly alike; they are more or less pear-shaped,
with a colourless anterior end, 2 cilia, a red “eye-spot,” etc. After
swarming for some time they approach each other, two and two, generally
a large and a smaller one, and come into contact at their colourless
end; in a few moments they coalesce and become one cell (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>
<i>E</i>, <i>F</i>), this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> has at first a large colourless anterior
end, 4 cilia, and 2 “eye-spots” (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>G</i>), but these soon
disappear and the cell becomes uniformly dark-green and spherical, and
surrounds itself with a thick cell-wall, losing at the same time its
power of motion: the zygote (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>H</i>) is formed, and becomes
later on a deep red colour. On the germination of the zygote, the
protoplasmic cell-contents burst open the wall (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>J</i>), and
emerge as a large swarmspore (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>K</i>) which divides into 16
cells, and the first small individual is formed (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a> <i>L</i>,
<i>M</i>).</p>

<p><i>Eudorina</i> is like <i>Pandorina</i> in structure, but stands
somewhat higher, since the contrast between the conjugating sexual
cells is greater, the female one being a motionless oosphere.</p>

<p>The highest stage of development is found in <i>Volvox</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>).
The cells are here arranged on the circumference of a sphere, and
enclose a cavity filled with mucilage. The number of these cells may
vary from 200–22,000, of which the majority are vegetative and not
reproductive, but some become large, motionless oospheres (Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>
<i>b</i>); others, which may appear as solitary individuals, divide
and form disc-shaped masses of from 8–256 small spermatozoids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> (Fig.
<a href="#fig46">46</a> <i>a</i>). After the oosphere has been fertilised by these, the
oospore surrounds itself by a thick, sometimes thorny cell-wall, and
on germination becomes a new individual of few cells. A few cells
conspicuous by their larger size may be found (1–9, but generally 8)
in certain individuals, and these provide the vegetative reproduction,
each forming by division a new individual.</p>

reproduction takes place by zoospores (or by motionless cells without
cilia), which unite and form a family similar to the mother-family,
inside the mother-cell, or in a mucilaginous envelope. Where sexual

<p>The cœnobium of <i>Hydrodictyon reticulatum</i> (Water-net) is formed
of a large number of cells which are cylindrical, and attached to one
another by the ends (Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>). The asexual reproduction takes place by
zoospores, which are formed in large numbers (7,000–20,000) in each
mother-cell, within which they move about for a time, and then come to
rest and arrange themselves into a new net (Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a> <i>A</i>) which
is set free by the dissolution of the wall of the mother-cell, grows,
and becomes a new cœnobium. The sexual reproduction takes place by
gamete-conjugation. The gametes are formed in the same manner as the
zoospores, but in larger numbers (30,000–100,000), and swarm out of
the mother-cell (Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a> <i>B</i>). The zygote forms, on germination,
2–5 large zoospores, each with one or two cilia, these generally
swarm about for a time, and after a period of rest become irregular
thorny bodies (polyhedra); their contents again divide into zoospores,
the thorny external coating of the polyhedra is cast off, and the
zoospores, surrounded by the dilated internal coating, unite to form a
small family, which produces several others in the manner described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Confervoideæ.</b></h4>

<p>The individuals are always multicellular, the cells firmly bound
together and united into unbranched or branched filaments, expansions,
or masses of cells which grow by intercallary divisions or have
apical growth. In the first seven orders the cells are uninuclear,
but the cells of the remaining three orders contain several nuclei.
Asexual reproduction by zoospores, akinetes or aplanospores. Sexual
reproduction by isogamous or oogamous fertilisation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Confervoideæ, through the Ulvaceæ, are connected with the
Tetrasporaceæ, and from the <i>Coleochætaceæ</i>, which is
the most highly developed order, there are the best reasons
for supposing that the Mosses have taken their origin.
The <i>Cladophoraceæ</i> show the nearest approach to the
<i>Siphoneæ</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Ulvaceæ.</b> The thallus consists of one or two layers
of parenchymatous cells, connected together to form either a
flat membrane (<i>Monostroma</i>, <i>Ulva</i>) or a hollow tube
(<i>Enteromorpha</i>), and may be either simple, lobed, or branched.
Reproduction takes place by detached portions of the thallus; or
asexually by zoospores or akinetes. Gamete-conjugation is known to take
place in some members of this order, the zygote germinating without any
resting-stage. The majority are found in salt or brackish water.</p>

  </div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Ulothricaceæ.</b> The thallus consists normally of a simple
unbranched filament (sometimes a small expansion consisting of one
layer of cells is formed, as in <i>Schizomeris</i> and <i>Prasiola</i>
which were formerly described as separate genera). Asexual reproduction
takes place by means of zoospores (with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> 1, 2, or 4 cilia), akinetes or
aplanospores; the last named may germinate immediately, or only after
a period of rest. Sexual reproduction takes place by the conjugation
of gametes of about the same size, each having two cilia (Fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>
<i>d</i>). The zygote of <i>Ulothrix</i>, on germination, produces a
brood of zoospores which swarm for a time and then elongate to become
<i>Ulothrix</i>-filaments (alternation of generations). The gametes
may also germinate without conjugation in the same manner as the
zoospores. The principal genera are: <i>Ulothrix</i>, <i>Hormidium</i>,
<i>Conferva</i>, <i>Microspora</i>.&mdash;<i>Ulothrix zonata</i> is
very common in running fresh water. Nearly all the species of
<i>Hormidium</i> occur on damp soil, tree-stems and stones.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Chætophoraceæ.</b> The thallus consists of a single,
branched, erect or creeping filament of cells, often surrounded by
mucilage. The cells have only one nucleus. Asexual reproduction
by zoospores with 2 or 4 cilia, by akinetes, or aplanospores. In
many, conjugation between gametes with 2 cilia may be found. They
approach on one side, Ulothricaceæ, and on the other, Mycoideaceæ.
The principal genera are: <i>Stigeoclonium</i>, <i>Draparnaldia</i>,
<i>Chætophora</i>, <i>Entoderma</i>, <i>Aphanochæte</i>,
<i>Herposteiron</i>, <i>Phæothamnion</i>, <i>Chlorotylium</i>,
<i>Trichophilus</i>, <i>Gongrosira</i>, <i>Trentepohlia</i>. Most of
the species of <i>Trentepohlia</i> are coloured red by the presence of
a red colouring material, which occurs in addition to the chlorophyll.
They are aerial Algæ which live on stones (<i>T. jolithus</i>, “violet
stone,” so named on account of its violet-like odour in rainy weather),
on bark and old wood (<i>T. umbrina</i>), or on damp rocks (<i>T.
aurea</i>). <i>Trichophilus welckeri</i> lives in the hair of Bradypus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 4. <b>Mycoideaceæ.</b> The thallus is discoid, consisting
of one or more cell-layers, and is always attached. Asexual
reproduction by zoospores with 2 or 4 cilia. Sexual reproduction
in some species by the conjugation of gametes with 2 cilia. This
order forms the connecting link between <i>Chætophoraceæ</i>
and <i>Coleochætaceæ</i>. The species occur in fresh water
(<i>Chætopeltis</i>) as well as in salt (<i>Pringsheimia</i>),
on the carapace of tortoises (<i>Dermatophyton</i> =
<i>Epiclemmydia</i>), or endophytic between the cuticle and the
epidermal cells of the leaves of tropical plants, destroying the
leaf-tissue (<i>Mycoidea</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>Order 5. <b>Cylindrocapsaceæ.</b> The thallus consists of a simple
(rarely, in parts, formed of many rows) unbranched filament, attached
in the young condition, which has short cells with a single nucleus,
and is enveloped in a thick envelope with a laminated structure.
Asexual reproduction by zoospores with 2 cilia, which are formed 1,
2, or 4 in each vegetative cell. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> antheridia are produced by a
single cell, or a group of cells, in a filament, dividing several times
without increasing in size. Two egg-shaped spermatozoids, each with 2
cilia (Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a> <i>D</i>), are formed in each antheridium, and escape
through an aperture in the side; in the first stages they are enclosed
in a bladder-like membrane (Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a> <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>). Other cells
of the filament swell out and form oogonia (Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a> <i>A</i>), which
resemble those of <i>Œdogonium</i>. After fertilisation, the oospore
surrounds itself with a thick wall, and assumes a reddish colour. The
germination is unknown. The unfertilised oospheres remain green, divide
often into 2–4 daughter-cells, and grow into new filaments.</p>

<p>This order, which only includes one genus, <i>Cylindrocapsa</i>, forms
the connecting link between <i>Ulothricaceæ</i> and <i>Œdogoniaceæ</i>.
The few species (4) occur only in fresh water.</p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Œdogoniaceæ.</b> The thallus consists of branched
(<i>Bulbochæte</i>) or unbranched (<i>Œdogonium</i>) filaments,
attached in the early stages. The cells may be longer or shorter,
and have one nucleus. Asexual reproduction by zoospores, which have
a chaplet of cilia round the base of the colourless end (Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a>
<i>a</i>). Sexual reproduction takes place by oogamous fertilisation.
On the germination of the oospore, 4 zoospores are formed (Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>
<i>F</i>). They occur only in fresh or slightly brackish water. The
division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> of the cells takes place in quite a peculiar and unusual
manner. At the upper end of the cell which is about to divide, a
ring-shaped thickening of soft cellulose is formed transversely round
the wall; the cell-nucleus of the mother-cell and the protoplasm then
divide by a transverse wall into two portions of similar size, and the
cell-wall bursts transversely along the central line of the thickened
ring. The cell-wall thus divides into two parts&mdash;the upper one short,
the “cap,” and the lower one much longer, the “sheath.” The portions
of the original cell-wall now separate from each other, the cellulose
ring extending, and supplying an additional length of cell-wall between
them. The cap and sheath will project a little in front of the piece
thus inserted. The dividing wall between the two new cells is formed
near to the uppermost edge of the sheath, and gradually becomes thicker
and firmer. The inserted piece of wall forms the larger part of the
wall of the upper cell: the remainder is formed by the cap. This mode
of division is repeated exactly in the same way, and new caps are
formed close below the first one, one for every division.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>Fertilisation takes place in the following way. The oogonium is a
large ellipsoidal, swollen cell (<i>og</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a> <i>A</i>),
whose contents are rounded off into an oosphere with a colourless
receptive-spot (see <i>B</i>); an aperture is formed in the wall of
the oogonium, through which the spermatozoids are enabled to enter
(<i>B</i>). The spermatozoids are produced either directly, as in
<i>D</i> (in pairs), in basal cells of the filament, or indirectly.
In the latter case a swarmspore (<i>androspore</i>) is formed which
comes to rest, attaches itself to an oogonium, germinates, and gives
rise to a filament of a very few cells&mdash;<i>dwarf-male</i> (<i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>, <i>m</i>). The spermatozoids are formed in the upper cell
of the dwarf-male (<i>m</i>), and are set free by the summit of the
antheridium lifting off like a lid. On the germination of the oospore
(<i>C</i>), which takes place in the following spring, 4 zoospores are
produced (<i>F</i>) (<i>i.e.</i> the sexual generation); these swarm
about for a time, and ultimately grow into new filaments.</p>

of cells united in a pseudo-parenchymatous manner. Each cell has only
one nucleus. Asexual reproduction by zoospores with 2 cilia (Fig. <a href="#fig55">55</a>
<i>D</i>), which may arise in all the cells. Sexual reproduction by
oogamous fertilisation. The spermatozoids resemble the swarmspores,
but are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> smaller (<i>E</i>), and originate singly (in the species
figured) in small conical cells (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i> in <i>A</i>). The
oogonia are developed at the extremities of certain branches: they are
bottle-shaped cells with very long and thin necks (<i>trichogyne</i>),
open at the end (<i>a</i> in <i>A</i>); at the base of each oogonium
is a spherical oosphere. The spermatozoids reach the oosphere through
the trichogyne, or through an aperture in the wall when the trichogyne
is absent, and fertilisation having taken place, the oogonium becomes
surrounded by a cell-layer (envelope), which grows out from the cells
near its base (<i>b</i> in <i>A</i>), and in this way a kind of fruit
is formed (<i>B</i>) (<i>spermocarp</i>, <i>cystocarp</i>).</p>

<p>The oospore, next spring, divides and forms a parenchymatous
tissue (homologous with the Moss-sporophyte); this bursts open the
envelope (<i>C</i>), and a zoospore (homologous with the spores of
the Moss-capsule) arises in each of the cells, and produces a new
<i>Coleochæte</i>. We have then, in this case, a still more distinct
alternation of generations than in <i>Œdogonium</i>. Only one genus,
<i>Coleochæte</i>, is known, but it contains several species, all
living in fresh water.</p>

<p>Order 8. <b>Cladophoraceæ.</b> This order is probably derived from
the Ulothricaceæ. The thallus consists of a single, unbranched or
branched filament, generally with an apical cell. The cells have each
2 or more nuclei. Asexual reproduction by zoospores with 2 or 4 cilia,
and by akinetes. Conjugation of gametes with 2 cilia is found in some
genera. They occur in salt as well as in fresh water. The principal
genera are: <i>Urospora</i>, <i>Chætomorpha</i>, <i>Rhizoclonium</i>,
<i>Cladophora</i>; of the last named genus the species <i>C. lanosa</i>

<p>Order 10. <b>Sphæropleaceæ.</b> The thallus consists of free,

vegetative cells form no zoospores. Sexual reproduction by oogamous
fertilisation (see page <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a> <i>B</i>). The oospore has a thick
wall (Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a> <i>D</i>) studded with warts, and assumes a colour
resembling red lead. It germinates only in the following spring, and
produces 1–8 zoospores, each with 2 cilia (Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a> <i>E</i>), which
grow into new filaments. Only one species, <i>Sphæroplea annulina</i>,
is known.</p>

<h4>Family 3. <b>Siphoneæ.</b></h4>

<p>The thallus has apical growth, and in the vegetative condition
consists generally of one single (in the Valoniaceæ most frequently
of more) multinuclear cell, which may be much branched, and whose
separate parts in the higher forms (<i>e.g. Bryopsis</i>,
Fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>; <i>Caulerpa</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, etc.) may be differentiated to
perform the various physiological functions (as root, stem and leaf).
Vegetative multiplication by detached portions of the thallus (gemmæ);
asexual reproduction by zoospores, akinetes, or aplanospores. Sexual
reproduction by gamete-conjugation, rarely by oogamous fertilisation.
The zygote or oospore germinates as a rule without any resting-stage.</p>

or repeatedly dichotomously branched system of colourless rhizoids
(<i>Botrydium</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a> <i>a</i>), by which it is attached to
objects immersed in salt water (<i>Codiolum</i>) or to damp clay
soil (<i>Botrydium</i>). Asexual reproduction by zoospores with one
(<i>Botrydium</i>) or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> cilia, and by aplanospores. The sexual
reproduction is only known in <i>Botrydium</i>, and takes place in the
following manner: in the part of the thallus which is above ground
and in an active vegetative condition, several round cells (Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>
<i>c</i>) are formed, which may be green or red according as they
grow under water, or exposed to the strong light of the sun. These
cells must be considered as “gametangia” as they produce many gametes
(<i>d</i>) provided with two cilia. The zygote (<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>)
formed by the conjugation (<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) may either
germinate immediately, or become a thick-walled resting-cell of an
irregular, angular form.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 2. <b>Bryopsidaceæ.</b> The thallus in the vegetative
condition is unicellular, and consists at the lower extremity of
branched rhizoids, while the upper portion is prolonged into a
stem-like structure of unlimited growth, producing, acropetally,
branches and leaf-like structures. The latter have limited
growth, and are separated by a cross wall from the stem, and
become gametangia, or drop off. The gametes have two cilia, and
are of two kinds: the female, which are green and large and the
male, which are of brownish colour and smaller. Zoospores or
any other method of asexual reproduction are unknown. Only one
genus, <i>Bryopsis</i>, living in salt water.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Derbesiaceæ.</b> Only one genus, <i>Derbesia</i>,
living in saltwater. The zoospores, which are formed in a few
lateral, swollen zoosporangia, possess one nucleus which has
arisen through the coalescence of several, and they resemble
the zoospores of <i>Œdogonium</i> by having a circle of cilia
attached at the base of the colourless spot.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 4. <b>Vaucheriaceæ.</b> The thallus consists, in the vegetative
condition, of a single irregularly or dichotomously branched cell,
without differentiation into stem or leaf; root-like organs of
attachment may however occur. Asexual reproduction by zoospores, which
are formed singly in the extremity of a branch cut off by a transverse
wall. They contain many nuclei, and bear small cilia situated in pairs,
which give the appearance of a fine “pile” covering the whole or a
great part of the surface. Akinetes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> aplanospores, and phytoamœbæ
(naked masses of protoplasm, without cilia, which creep like an amœba
on a substratum) may occur under certain conditions.</p>

<p>The sexual reproductive organs are formed on short lateral branches,
and are separated from the vegetative cell (Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a> <i>A</i>) by
cell-walls. Numerous spermatozoids, each with two cilia, are developed
in the coiled antheridium (<i>A</i>, <i>b</i>). The oogonium is a
thick, egg-shaped, often oblique cell, with its protoplasm rounded into
an oosphere, which has a hyaline “receptive-spot” (<i>A</i>, <i>a</i>)
immediately beneath the aperture formed in the wall of the oogonium.
A slimy mass, which serves to receive the spermatozoids, is formed
in some species in this aperture. The spermatozoids when liberated
swim towards and enter the oosphere, which then immediately surrounds
itself with a thick cell-wall. The mature oospore (<i>B</i>) contains
a large quantity of oil. At germination the outer cell-wall bursts and
a new plant is formed. There is only one genus, <i>Vaucheria</i>, with
species living in salt as well as in fresh water and on damp soil.</p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Caulerpaceæ.</b> The thallus has distinct differentiation
into root, stem and leaf-like members (Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>); it is unicellular.
Within the cell, strong, branched threads of cellulose extend from one
side to the other serving as stays to support the thallus. Reproduction
takes place by detached portions of the thallus; no other modes of
reproduction are known. This order may most approximately be classed
with the <i>Bryopsidaceæ</i>. The genus <i>Caulerpa</i> consists of
more than seventy species which inhabit the tropical seas.</p>

<p>Order 7. <b>Codiaceæ.</b> The thallus has various forms, but without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
distinct differentiation in stem- or leaf-structures, sometimes
(<i>e.g. Halimeda</i>) it is very much incrusted with lime.
In the early stages it is unicellular (later, often multicellular),
very much branched, with the branches, at any rate partly, so
united or grown in amongst one another (Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>) that an apparently
parenchymatous cellular body is formed. Akinetes or aplanospores are
wanting; zoospores (or gametes?) may be developed in some species,
however, in special swollen sporangia. Fertilisation similar to that
in <i>Bryopsis</i> occurs perhaps in <i>Codium</i>. They are all salt
water forms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 8. <b>Valoniaceæ.</b> The thallus is generally
multicellular, without differentation into stem- or
leaf-structures, but the cells are sometimes united together
and form a leaf-like reticulate expansion (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Anadyomene</i>). Zoospores are known in some, and they
are then formed directly in the vegetative cells. In others
(<i>e.g. Valonia</i>), a mass of protoplasm, which
maybe separated through the damaging of a cell, can surround
itself with a cell-wall, and grow into a new plant. No other
modes of reproduction are known. The most important genera
are: <i>Valonia</i>, <i>Siphonocladus</i>, <i>Chamædoris</i>,
<i>Struvea</i>, <i>Microdictyon</i>, <i>Anadyomene</i>. They are

by root-like organs of attachment, and producing acropetally whorls of
united, single or branched, leaf-like structures with limited growth.
Asexual reproduction is wanting. Sexual reproduction by conjugation
of gametes which arise in separate, fertile leaves, either directly
or from aplanospores, which develope into gametangia. The principal
genera are: <i>Acetabularia</i>, <i>Dasycladus</i>, <i>Neomeris</i>,

<p>The curiously shaped <i>Acetabularia mediterranea</i> grows
gregariously on limestone rocks, and shells of mussels in the
Mediterranean; it resembles a minute umbrella with a small stem,
sometimes as much as nine centimetres in height, and a shade which
may be more than one centimetre in diameter. The cell-membrane is
thick, and incrusted with carbonate and oxalate of lime. Only the
lower, root-like part of the thallus, which penetrates the calcareous
substratum survives the winter, and may grow up into a new plant. The
sterile leaves, which drop off early, are dichotomously branched and
formed of cylindrical cells separated from each other by cross-walls,
but they are not grown together. The shade is formed by a circle of
70–100 club-shaped rays (fertile leaves) grown together, in each
ray 40–80 aplanospores are formed, which become liberated at the
breaking of the shade, and later on are changed to gametangia (compare
<i>Botrydium</i>) which open by a lid and allow a large number of
egg-shaped gametes with two cilia to escape. Gametes from various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
gametangia conjugate with one another; the product of the conjugation
swarms about for some time, rounds off, and then surrounds itself with
a cell-wall. The zygote germinates after a period of rest and then
produces a sexual plant. The aplanospores (gametangia) thus represent
the sexual generation.</p>


<h3>Class 7. <b>Characeæ.</b></h3>

<p>The thallus has a stem with nodes and internodes; and whorls of leaves,
on which may be developed the antheridia and oogonia, are borne at
the nodes. Vegetative reproduction by bulbils and accessory shoots.
Zoospores are wanting. The antheridia are spherical, and contain a
number of filaments in which the spirally coiled spermatozoids, each
with two cilia, are formed. The oogonium is situated terminally, and
is at first naked, but becomes later on surrounded by an investment,
and forms after fertilisation the so-called “fruit.” The oospore, after
a period of rest, germinates by producing a “proembryo,” from which
the young sexual plant arises as a lateral branch. The Characeæ are
distinguished by the structure of their vegetative system as well as by
the spirally-coiled spermatozoids, and stand as an isolated group among
the Thallophytes, of which, however, the Siphoneæ appear to be their
nearest relations. They were formerly, but wrongly, placed near the
Mosses. The class contains only one order, the Characeæ.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Characeæ.</b> Algæ with a peculiar odour, often incrusted
with lime, and of a brittle nature. They generally grow gregariously
in large masses at the bottom of fresh and brackish water, and are
from a few inches to more than a foot in height. The stem has long
internodes which in <i>Nitella</i> are formed of one cylindrical cell;
in <i>Chara</i> of a similar cell, but closely surrounded by a cortical
layer of smaller ones. The protoplasm in contact with the cell-wall
exhibits in a well-marked degree the movement of rotation (cyclosis),
carrying the chlorophyll corpuscles along with it. The internodes are
separated from each other by a layer of small cells (nodal cells)
from which the leaves are produced. The leaves are borne in whorls of
from 5–12 which regularly alternate with one another as in the higher
verticillate plants; a branch is borne in the axil of the first formed
leaf of each whorl (Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a> <i>A</i>, <i>n</i>).</p>

<p>The leaves are constructed in the same manner as the stem; they are
divided into a series of joints, but have only a limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> power of
growth; their terminal cell, too, is not enclosed by a cortex. Leaflets
are borne at their nodes. The growth of the stem is unlimited, and
proceeds by means of an apical cell (Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a> <i>s</i>). The apical cell
divides into a segment-cell and a new apical cell. The segment-cell
then divides by a transverse wall into two cells, one lying above the
other; the lower one, without any further division, becomes one of the
long, cylindrical, internodal cells (Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a> <i>in</i>), and the upper
one (Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a> <i>n</i>) divides by vertical walls to form the nodal
cells. The cortical cells (Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a> <i>r</i>) which surround the long
internodal cells of <i>Chara</i>, are derived from the divisions of the
nodal cells; the cells covering the upper portion of an internodal cell
being derived from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> node immediately above it, and those in the
lower part of the internode from the node below it.</p>

<p>The organs of reproduction are very conspicuous by their colour and
form. They are always situated on the leaves, the plants being very
frequently monœcious. The antheridia (Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a> <i>B</i>, <i>a</i>) are
modified leaflets or the terminal cell of a leaf; they are spherical
and become red when mature. Their wall consists of 8 “shields,”
<i>i.e.</i> of plate-like cells, 4 of which cover the upper half, and
are triangular; the 4 round the lower half, to which the stalk of the
antheridia is attached, being quadrilateral, with sides of unequal
length. The shields (Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a> <i>C</i>) have dentated edges, with the
teeth fitting into one another, and their faces ornamented with ridges.
From the centre of the internal face of each shield (<i>C</i>) a
cylindrical cell, the <i>manubrium</i>, projects nearly as far as the
centre of the antheridium; at the inner end of each of the manubria a
spherical cell, the <i>capitulum</i>, is situated. Each capitulum bears
six secondary capitula, from each of which four long coiled filaments
(<i>C</i>, <i>D</i>) project into the cavity of the antheridium. These
filaments are divided by transverse walls into from 100–200 discoid
cells, in each of which a biciliated, coiled spermatozoid is developed
(<i>D</i>, <i>E</i>) from the nucleus. The spermatozoids escape from
their mother-cell and are set free by the shields separating from one
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>The female organ of reproduction (Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a> <i>B</i>, 63) is a small
modified shoot, whose apical cell functions as an oogonium, its
protoplasm forming the oosphere, which has a colourless receptive-spot
at the summit (Fig. <a href="#fig63">63</a> <i>u</i>). The oogonium is situated on a nodal
cell, from which 5 cells grow out in a circle and coil round the
oogonium, covering it with a close investment. These cells divide
once or twice at the top, so that 5 or 10 small cells are cut off,
which project above the oogonium and form the so-called “crown”
(Fig. <a href="#fig63">63</a> <i>k</i>). The crown either drops off at fertilisation, or
its cells separate to form a central canal for the passage of the
spermatozoids. The wall of the oosphere<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> above the receptive spot
becomes mucilaginous, and allows the spermatozoid to fuse with the
oosphere. The oospore, on germination (Fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a> <i>sp</i>), becomes a
small filamentous plant of limited growth (Fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a> <i>i</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>q</i>, <i>pl</i>)&mdash;the proembryo&mdash;and from this, as a lateral
outgrowth, the sexual generation is produced.</p>

<p>The order is divided into two sub-orders:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">Nitelleæ.</span> The crown consists of 10 cells; cortex absent:
<i>Nitella</i>, <i>Tolypella</i>.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Chareæ.</span> The crown consists of 5 cells; cortex present:
<i>Tolypellopsis</i>, <i>Lamprothamnus</i>, <i>Lychnothamnus</i>,

only female plants are found, yet oospheres are formed capable of
germination.</p>

<h3>Class 8. <b>Phæophyceæ (Olive-Brown Seaweeds).</b></h3>

<p>The Phæophyceæ are Algæ, with chromatophores in which the chlorophyll
is masked by a brown colour (phycophæin). The product of assimilation
is a carbohydrate (fucosan), <i>never true starch</i>. In the highest
forms (<i>Fucaceæ</i>), the thallus presents differentiation into
stem, leaf, and root-like structures. The asexual reproduction takes
place by means of zoospores. The sexual reproduction is effected by
the coalescence of motile gametes, or by oogamous fertilisation. The
swarm-cells are <i>monosymmetric</i>, each moved by two cilia which are
true protoplasmic structures, and generally <i>attached laterally</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>). The Phæophyceæ are almost entirely saltwater forms; a few
species of <i>Lithoderma</i> live in fresh water.</p>

<p>The class is divided into two families:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Phæosporeæ</span>: 1 Sub-Family, Zoogonicæ; 2 Sub-Family, Acinetæ.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Cyclosporeæ</span>: Fucaceæ.</p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Phæosporeæ.</b></h4>

<p>The family consists of multicellular plants, whose cells are firmly
united together to form a thallus; this, in the simplest cases, may be
a branched filament of cells (<i>Ectocarpus</i>), or, in the highest,
may resemble a stem with leaves (<i>Laminariaceæ</i>), while all
transitional forms may be found between these two. The thallus grows by
intercalary divisions (<i>e.g. Ectocarpus</i>), or by an apical
cell (<i>e.g. Sphacelaria</i>); pseudo-parenchymatous tissue may
sometimes be formed by cells, which were originally distinct, becoming
united together. The size of the thallus varies; in some species it is
quite small&mdash;almost microscopical,&mdash;while in the largest it is many
metres in length.</p>

<p>The vegetative cells in the lower forms are nearly uniform, but
in those which are more highly developed (<i>Laminariaceæ</i> and
<i>Fucaceæ</i>), they are sometimes so highly differentiated that
mechanical, assimilating, storing and conducting systems may be found;
the last named systems are formed of long cells with perforated,
transverse walls, which bear a strong resemblance to the sieve-tubes in
the higher plants.</p>

are a lighter or darker <i>yellow-brown</i>. Starch is not formed.
Asexual reproduction takes place, (1) by zoospores which arise in
unilocular zoosporangia, and are monosymmetric, with two cilia attached
laterally at the base of the colourless anterior end (Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>), the
longer one being directed forwards and the shorter backwards; or (2) by
aplanospores (?).</p>

  </div>

<p>Sexual reproduction has only been discovered in a few cases, and takes
place by means of gametes (oogamous fertilisation perhaps occurs in the
Tilopteridæ). The gametes have the same structure as the zoospores,
and arise in multilocular gametangia; these, like the zoosporangia,
are outgrowths from the external surface, or arise as modifications
from it. The conjugating gametes may be similar (<i>e.g. Ectocarpus
pusillus</i>), or there may be a more or less pronounced difference of
sex, an indication of which is found in <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>). When the gametes in this species have swarmed for a time,
some, which are generally larger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> are seen to attach themselves
by one of the cilia, which by degrees is shortened to form a kind
of stalk (compare the upper gamete in Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a> <i>II</i>); these
are the female gametes, which now become surrounded by a number of
males endeavouring to conjugate with them, but only one succeeds in
effecting fertilisation. The protoplasm of the two gametes coalesces
(Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a> <i>III</i>), and a zygote (<i>e</i>) is formed. The male
gametes which do not conjugate may germinate, but the plants derived
from them are much weaker than those produced by the zygotes. Strongly
pronounced sexual differences are found in the Cutleriaceæ, in which
order the male and female gametes arise in separate gametangia (Fig.
<a href="#fig67">67</a> <i>A</i>). The male gametes (Fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a> <i>D</i>) are much smaller
than the female gamete (Fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a> <i>C</i>); the latter, after swarming
for a short time, withdraws the cilia, and is then ready to become
fertilised (Fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a> <i>B</i>, <i>E</i>), thus we have here a distinct
transition to the oogamous fertilisation which is found in the Fucaceæ.
Alternation of generations is rarely found.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Ectocarpaceæ.</b> The thallus consists of single or
branched filaments with intercalary growth, extending vertically from a
horizontal, branched filament or a disc, but sometimes it is reduced to
this basal portion only. Zoosporangia and gametangia (for fertilisation
see Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>) are either outgrowths or arise by the transformation of

     <p class="p0 sm"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;<i>Laminaria digitata</i> (much
reduced in size).</p>
  </div>

<p>Order 16. <b>Laminariaceæ.</b> The thallus is more or less leathery,
and has generally a root-like lower part (Fig. <a href="#fig69">69</a>) which serves to
attach it, and a stalk or stem-like part, terminated by a large
leaf-like expansion. Meristematic cells are situated at the base of
the leaf, and from these the new leaves are derived. The older leaf
thus pushed away by the intercalary formation of the younger ones, soon
withers (Fig. <a href="#fig69">69</a>). Gametes are wanting. Zoosporangia are developed from
the lower part of a simple, few-celled sporangiophore, which is an
outgrowth from a surface-cell and has a large club-formed apical cell.
The sporangia are aggregated into closely packed sori, which cover
the lower part of the terminal leaf, or occur on special, smaller,
lateral, fertile fronds (<i>Alaria</i>). Most of the species belonging
to this order live in seas of moderate or cold temperature and occur
in the most northern regions that have yet been explored, forming
their organs of reproduction during the cold and darkness of the
arctic night. <i>Laminaria</i> is destitute of a midrib and has only
one terminal leaf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> <i>L. digitata</i> has a broad leaf, which, by the
violence of the waves, is torn into a number of palmate strips (Fig.
<a href="#fig69">69</a>). <i>L. saccharina</i> has a small, undivided leaf. <i>Alaria</i>
has a midrib and special fertile fronds. <i>A. esculenta</i> occurs
plentifully on the west coast of Norway and on the shores of Great
Britain. <i>Chorda filum</i>, a common seaweed, is thick, unbranched,
and attains a length of several metres, without any strong demarcation
between stalk and leaf. Some attain quite a gigantic size, <i>e.g.
Macrocystis pyrifera</i>, whose thallus is said sometimes to be more
than 300 metres in length. The <i>Lessonia</i>-species, like the above,
form submarine forests of seaweed on the south and south-west coasts
of South America, the Cape, and other localities in the Southern
Hemisphere.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> The large Laminarias, where they occur in great
numbers, are, like the Fuci, used for various purposes, for
example, in the production of iodine and soda, and as an article
of food (<i>Laminaria saccharina</i>, <i>Alaria esculenta</i>,
etc.). <i>Laminaria saccharina</i> contains a large quantity of
sugar (mannit) and is in some districts used in the preparation
of a kind of syrup; in surgical operations it is employed for
the distension of apertures and passages, as for instance the
ear-passage. It is by reason of the anatomical peculiarities
and structure of the cell-walls, that they are employed for
this purpose. The cell-walls are divided into two layers, an
inner one which has very little power of swelling, and an
outer one, well developed and almost gelatinous&mdash;the so-called
“intercellular substance”&mdash;which shrivels up when dried, but can
absorb water and swell to about five times its size. The stalks
of <i>Laminaria clustoni</i> are officinal.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 17. <b>Cutleriaceæ.</b> The thallus is formed by the union of the
originally free, band-shaped shoots. The growth is intercalary. Sexual
reproduction by the conjugation of male and female gametes. An asexual
generation of different appearance, which produces zoospores, arises
from the germination of the zygote. <i>Cutleria</i>, <i>Zanardinia</i>.</p>

<p>Sub-Family 2. <b>Acinetæ.</b></p>

<p>Branched, simple cell-rows with intercalary growth. The organs
of reproduction are partly uni-and partly multicellular; in the
unicellular ones a cell without cilia is formed, which may be destitute
of a cell-wall, but has one nucleus (oosphere?), or which has a
cell-wall and contains several (generally four) nuclei (aplanospores?);
in the multicellular, monosymmetric swarm-cells with two cilia
(spermatozoids?) are formed. The fertilisation has not been observed.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Tilopteridaceæ.</b> <i>Haplospora</i>, <i>Tilopteris</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Cyclosporeæ.</b></h4>

<p>The individuals are multicellular, with growth by an apical cell.
The thallus&mdash;often bilateral&mdash;is differentiated into a root-like
structure (attachment-disc), and stem, sometimes also into leaves
(<i>Sargassum</i>). Sometimes a differentiation occurs into various
tissue-systems, viz. an external assimilating tissue, a storing tissue,
a mechanical tissue of thickened, longitudinal, parenchymatous,
strengthening cells, and a conducting tissue of sieve-cells, or of
short sieve-tubes with perforated walls. Colouring material, as in
Phæosporeæ. Vegetative reproduction can only take place by means of
detached portions of the thallus (<i>Sargassum</i>), which are kept
floating by means of bladders (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>A</i>, <i>a</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig72">72</a>).
Zoospores are wanting.</p>

<p>The sexual reproduction takes place by oogamous fertilisation. The
oogonia and antheridia are formed inside special organs (conceptacles),
and are surrounded by paraphyses. The conceptacles (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>B</i>,
Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a> <i>b</i>) are small, pear-shaped or spherical depressions,
produced by a special ingrowth of the surface cells of the thallus,
and their mouths (<i>ostioles</i>) project like small warts; they are
either situated near the end of the ordinary branches of the thallus
(<i>Fucus serratus</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a> <i>a</i>) which may be swollen on this
account (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>A</i>, <i>b</i>), or on
special short branches (<i>Ascophyllum</i>, <i>Sargassum</i>). The
vertical section of a conceptacle is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>B</i> (see also
Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a> <i>b</i>) where, in addition to the paraphyses, oogonia only
are seen (<i>F. vesiculosus</i> is diœcious&mdash;male plant, yellow-brown;
female plant, olive-brown); but in some species antheridia, together
with oogonia, are produced in the same conceptacle. The oogonia are
large, almost spherical cells, situated on a short stalk, in each of
which are formed from 1–8 (in <i>Fucus</i>, 8; in <i>Ascophyllum</i>,
4; in <i>Halidrys</i>, 1; in <i>Pelvetia</i>, 2) rounded, immotile
oospheres. The wall of the oogonium ruptures, and the oospheres,
still enclosed in the inner membrane, are ejected through the mouth
of the conceptacle, and float about in the water, being finally set
free by the bursting of the inner membrane. The antheridia are oblong
cells (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>C</i>, <i>a</i>), many of which are produced on
the same branched antheridiophore (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>C</i>); the numerous
spermatozoids are provided with 2 cilia and are very small (Fig.
<a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>D</i>, two antheridia surrounded by spermatozoids, one being
open). The spermatozoids, still enclosed by the inner membrane of the
antheridium, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> similarly set free, and fertilisation takes place in
the water, numerous spermatozoids collecting round the oosphere (Fig.
<a href="#fig70">70</a> <i>E</i>), which is many times larger, and by their own motion
causing it to rotate. After fertilisation, the oospore surrounds itself
with a cell-wall and germinates immediately, attaching itself (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>
<i>F</i>) to some object, and by cell-division grows into a new plant.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Fucaceæ.</b> The following species are common on our
coasts: <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>) has a thallus with an
entire margin, and with bladders arranged in pairs; <i>F. serratus</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>) without bladders, but with serrated margin; <i>Ascophyllum
nodosum</i> has strap-like shoots, which here and there are swollen
to form bladders; <i>Halidrys siliquosa</i> has its swimming bladders
divided by transverse walls; <i>Himanthalia lorea</i>, which is found
on the west coast of Norway, and the south coast of England, has a
small perennial, button-shaped part, from the centre of which proceeds
the long and sparsely branched, strap-like, annual shoot, which bears
the conceptacles. The Gulf-weed (<i>Sargassum bacciferum</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig72">72</a>)
is well known historically from the voyage of Columbus; it is met with
in large, floating, detached masses in all oceans, and is found most
abundantly in the Atlantic, off the Canary Islands and the Azores,
and towards the Bermudas. The stalked, spherical air-bladders are
the characteristic feature of this genus. The thallus is more highly
developed than in <i>Fucus</i>, and there is a contrast between the
stem and leaf-like parts. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> portions which are found floating are
always barren, only those attached are fertile.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> The Fucaceæ, like the Laminariaceæ, are used
as manure (the best kinds being <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> and
<i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>), for burning to produce kelp, and
as food for domestic animals (<i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i> is
especially used for this purpose).</p>
</div>


<h3>Class 9. <b>Dictyotales.</b></h3>

<p>The plants in this class are multicellular, and brown, with apical
growth, new cells being derived either from a flat apical cell, or from
a border of apical cells. The thallus is flat, leaf- or strap-shaped,
attached by haptera, which are either found only at the base, or
on the whole of the lower expansion of the thallus. The cells are
differentiated into the following systems of tissues: an external,
small-celled layer of assimilating cells, generally one cell in
thickness, and an internal, large-celled layer of one or only a few
cells in thickness, forming the mechanical and conducting tissues.
All the reproductive cells are motionless. Asexual reproduction by
naked, motionless spores (tetraspores) which are formed 1–4 in each
tetrasporangium, the latter being outgrowths from the surface cells
of special, sexless individuals. Zoospores are wanting. The sexual
organs are of two kinds, oogonia and antheridia, which are formed from
the surface cells, either on the same or different individuals. The
oogonia are spherical or oval, and are generally placed close together;
each contains one oosphere, which on maturity is ejected into the
surrounding water, and is then naked and motionless. The antheridia
are formed of longitudinal cells, united in groups, whose contents
by repeated divisions&mdash;transverse and longitudinal&mdash;are divided into
a large number of small, colourless, motionless spermatia&mdash;round or
elongated&mdash;which are set free by the dissolution of the wall of the
antheridium. The process of fertilisation has not yet been observed.</p>

<p>The Dictyotales, in having tetraspores and spermatia, deviate
considerably from the Phæophyceæ, but may be classed near to the
Tilopteridæ, in which there are asexual spores with 4 cell-nuclei,
which may be considered as an indication of the formation of
tetraspores.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Dictyotaceæ.</b> <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i> which has
a thin, regularly dichotomously divided thallus, occurs on the
coasts of the British Isles. <i>Padina</i> is found on the south
coast.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>


<h3>Class 10. <b>Rhodophyceæ (Red Seaweeds).</b></h3>

<p>The plants comprised in this class are multicellular; they are
simple or branched filaments, or expansions consisting of 1 to
several layers of cells; the thallus may be differentiated (as in
many <i>Florideæ</i>), to resemble stem, root, and leaf. The cells
contain a distinctly differentiated nucleus (sometimes several), and
distinct chromatophores, coloured by rhodophyll. The chlorophyll of
the chromatophores is generally masked by a red colouring matter
(phycoerythrin), which may be extracted in cold, fresh water; or rarely
by phycocyan. Pyrenoids occur in some. Starch is never formed in the
chromatophores themselves, but a modification&mdash;Florideæ starch&mdash;may
be found in the colourless protoplasm. Asexual reproduction by motile
or motionless spores (tetraspores) which are devoid of cilia and of
cell-wall. Swarmspores are never found.</p>

<p>Sexual reproduction is wanting, or takes place by the coalescence of
a spermatium and a more or less developed female cell. The spermatia
are naked masses of protoplasm, devoid of cilia and chromatophores.
The female cell (carpogonium) is enclosed by a cell-wall, and after
fertilisation forms a number of spores, either with or without
cell-walls (carpospores), which grow into new individuals.</p>

<p>The Rhodophyceæ may be divided into two families:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Bangioideæ.</span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Florideæ.</span></p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Bangioideæ.</b></h4>

<p>The thallus consists of a branched or unbranched cell-filament, formed
of a single row or of many rows of cells, or of an expansion, one or
two layers of cells in thickness, but without conspicuous pores for the
intercommunication of the cells. The growth of the thallus is chiefly
intercalary. The star-like chromatophores contain chlorophyll and are
coloured blue-green with phycocyan, or reddish with phycoerythrin;
all these colouring matters are occasionally found in the same cell
(<i>Bangia</i>-species). Asexual reproduction by tetraspores, without
cilia, but capable of amœboid movements.</p>

<p>Sexual reproduction is wanting, or takes place by the coalescence of a
spermatium with a carpogonium, which is only slightly differentiated
from the vegetative cells, and is devoid of a trichogyne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> The
carpospores are destitute of cell-wall and arise directly by the
division of the fertilised oosphere. The Bangioideæ occur chiefly in
salt water.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Goniotrichaceæ.</b>&mdash;The thallus consists of a
branched cell-filament without rhizoids. Tetraspores are
formed directly from the entire contents of the mother-cell,
without any preceding division. Fertilisation unknown.
<i>Asterocystis</i>, <i>Goniotrichum</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Goniotrichaceæ</i>, through the blue-green
<i>Asterocystis</i>, are allied to the Myxophyceæ, and through
<i>Goniotrichum</i> to the <i>Porphyraceæ</i>.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Porphyraceæ.</b>&mdash;The thallus is formed of an
expansion consisting of a layer of 1–2 cells, which, at the
base, are attached to the substratum by means of a special
form of haptera (<i>Porphyra</i>, <i>Diploderma</i>); or of
unbranched (very rarely slightly branched) filaments, attached
at the base by haptera (<i>Bangia</i>): or it extends from a
prostrate cell-disc (various species of <i>Erythrotrichia</i>).
Tetraspores are formed after one or more divisions of the
mother-cell, either from the whole or only a part of its
contents; they possess amœboid movements, or have a jerky,
sliding-forward motion. The antheridia have the same appearance
as the vegetative cells, but divide several times, and several
spermatia are formed, either simultaneously from the whole
contents (<i>Porphyra</i>, <i>Bangia</i>), or the spermatia
are successively formed from a part of the contents of the
antheridium (<i>Erythrotrichia</i>). The carpogonium is without
a trichogyne, but the oosphere has a colourless spot which may
sometimes rise a little above the surface of the thallus, and
may be considered as an early stage in the development of the
trichogyne. The spermatia form a canal through the membrane of
the carpogonium, and their contents coalesce with the oosphere
at its colourless spot. The fertilised oosphere divides on
germination into a number of carpospores, which are set free as
naked, motionless masses of protoplasm, which grow and give rise
to new individuals (alternation of generations).</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Florideæ.</b></h4>

<p>The thallus has one or more apical cells, grows principally by apical
growth, and may be differentiated into root, stem, and leaf. The
chromatophores vary in form, but have a red or brownish colour, due
to chlorophyll and phycoerythrin. Asexual reproduction by motionless
tetraspores, which generally arise by the division into four of the
contents of the tetrasporangium. The carpogonium has a trichogyne,
and the carpospores, which are formed indirectly from the fertilised
oosphere, possess a cell-wall.</p>

  </div>

<p>The thallus may assume very different forms. In the simplest
species it is filamentous and formed of single, branched rows of
cells (<i>Callithamnion</i>, etc., Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>). <i>Ceramium</i> has a
filamentous thallus, generally dichotomously forked (Fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>), or
sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> pinnately branched, which, at the nodes, or throughout
its entire length, is covered by a layer of small cortical cells.
<i>Polysiphonia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a>) has a filamentous, much branched thallus,
made up of a central cylindrical cell, surrounded by a layer of
other cells, cortical cells, which in length and position correspond
to the central ones. In many of the Red Algæ the vegetative organs
are differentiated into stems and leaves, the former having, as in
<i>Chara</i>, unlimited growth in length, whilst the latter soon attain
their full development. <i>Chondrus</i> has a fleshy, gelatinous
thallus, without nodes; it is repeatedly forked into flat branches
of varying thickness. <i>Furcellaria</i> has a forked thallus with
thick branches and without nodes. The thallus of <i>Delesseria</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>) consists of branches, often bearing leaf-like structures,
with a midrib and lateral ribs springing from it. These ribs persist
through the winter, and at the commencement of the succeeding period of
vegetation the lateral ribs become the starting points for new leaves.
In <i>Corallina</i> the thallus is pinnately branched, and divided
into nodes and internodes. The name has been given to this genus from
the fact that the thallus is incrusted with carbonate of lime to such
a degree that it becomes very hard, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> whole plant adopts a
coral-like appearance. Other genera which are similarly incrusted, and
have a leaf-like or even crustaceous thallus (such as <i>Melobesia</i>,
<i>Lithothamnion</i>), are included in this family.</p>

<p>In some instances the cells of the thallus may be found
<i>differentiated</i> into more or less well defined tissues, so that
it is possible to find special assimilating, mechanical, and conducting
tissues, the last named in some cases having the double function of
conducting and of serving as a reservoir in which starch is found as a
reserve material. The cells of the Florideæ, which are formed by the
division of a mother-cell into two daughter-cells of unequal size, have
always larger or smaller pits in the cell-walls, and the thin cell-wall
separating two pits from each other is perforated by a number of small
holes. These pits are particularly developed in the conducting tissues,
but sieve-tubes are very rarely to be found.</p>

<p><i>Tetraspores</i> may be wanting (<i>e.g. Lemanea</i>) or may
often arise on special, non-sexual individuals. In some (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Batrachospermum</i>) only one tetraspore is formed in each
tetrasporangium, but the number is generally four, which may be formed
tetrahedrally (Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>) or by divisional walls perpendicular to each
other, or even in a single row. The tetrasporangia in some species are
free (Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>), but in the majority they are embedded in the thallus.</p>

<p>The sexual reproduction (discovered by Thuret and Bornet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> 1867)
differs in the essential points from that of all other plants,
and approaches most nearly to the sexual reproduction of the
<i>Bangioideæ</i>. The sexual cells are developed from the
terminal cells (never nodal cells) of the branched cell-filaments,
which constitute the thallus. The mother-cells of the spermatia
(<i>spermatangia</i>) are generally arranged in a group, in the
so-called <i>antheridia</i> (Figs.<a href="#fig74"> 74</a>, <a href="#fig77">77</a> <i>A</i>, <i>a</i>). On
becoming ripe the membrane of the spermatangium ruptures and the
<i>spermatia</i> emerge as spherical or ovoid, naked (a little later
they may possess a cell-wall) masses of protoplasm which are not
endowed with the power of motion, and hence are carried passively by
the current of the water in which they may happen to be, to the female
cell. This latter is analogous with the oogonium of the Green Algæ. The
female reproductive organ is termed the <i>procarpium</i>, and consists
of two parts, a lower swollen portion&mdash;the <i>carpogonium</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>
<i>b</i> in <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>)&mdash;which contains the cell-nucleus,
and an upper filamentous prolongation&mdash;the <i>trichogyne</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>
<i>B</i>)&mdash;which is homologous with the colourless receptive spot of
the oosphere of the Green Algæ, and the <i>Porphyraceæ</i>. In the
sexual reproduction of the majority of the Florideæ, a very important
part is played by certain special cells, rich in cell-contents&mdash;the
<i>auxiliary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> cells</i>. These are either dispersed in the interior of
the thallus, or are arranged together in pairs with the cell-filament
which bears the carpogonium, and are generally united with this to
form an independent multicellular <i>procarpium</i>. The spermatia
attach themselves firmly to the trichogyne and surround themselves
with a cell-wall. The dividing wall at the point of contact is
perforated, and the nucleus of the spermatium probably travels
through the trichogyne to the swollen part of the procarpium&mdash;the
<i>carpogonium</i>&mdash;and fuses with its nucleus. After fertilisation the
trichogyne withers (Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a> <i>C</i>), but the lower portion of the
procarpium, constituting the <i>fertilised oosphere</i>, grows out and
forms in various ways, first a tuft of spore-forming filaments known as
<i>gonimoblasts</i>, and finally the <i>carpospores</i>. These latter
form a new asexual generation (compare the germination of the oospore
of <i>Œdogonium</i> and <i>Coleochæte</i>).</p>

<p>The gonimoblasts may arise in three ways:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. In the <i>Nemalionales</i>, branched filaments grow out from
the oosphere and form an upright, compressed or expanded tuft of
spore-forming filaments.</p>

<p>2. In the <i>Cryptonemiales</i>, several branched or unbranched
filaments (<i>ooblastema-filaments</i>) grow out from the
oosphere, and conjugate in various ways with the auxiliary
cells. The gonimoblasts are then formed from the single cells
produced by the conjugation.</p>

<p>3. In the <i>Gigartinales</i> and <i>Rhodymeniales</i> the
oosphere conjugates with an auxiliary cell by means of a short
ooblastema-filament, and from this auxiliary cell a gonimoblast
is produced.</p>

<p>The motionless <i>carpospores</i>, which sometimes in the early
stages are naked, and afterwards invested with a cell-wall,
are developed from the terminal cells (and perhaps also from
some of the other cells) of the branches of the gonimoblast.
The gonimoblasts constitute sharply defined parts of the
plant in which the carpospores arise. These parts are called
<i>cystocarps</i> and are either naked (Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a> <i>E</i>),
or surrounded by a covering (pericarp or involucre, Fig.
<a href="#fig77">77</a> <i>A</i>) formed in different ways. On this account the
Florideæ were formerly divided into <span class="smcap">Gymnosporeæ</span>
(<i>Batrachospermum</i>, <i>Nemalion</i>, <i>Ceramium</i>, etc.)
and <span class="smcap">Angiosporeæ</span> (<i>Farcellaria</i>, <i>Lejolisia</i>,
<i>Delesseria</i>, <i>Melobesia</i>, etc.).</p>
</div>

<p>The Florideæ are divided into four sub-families:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sub-Family 1. <b>Nemalionales.</b> The fertilised oosphere
produces directly the gonimoblast.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Lemaneaceæ.</b> Algæ of brownish colour and living
in fresh water. They lack tetraspores, and the very sparingly
branched fertile filaments, composed of many rows of cells, grow
out from a proembryo, which consists of a single row of cells
bearing branches. <i>Lemanea fluviatilis</i>, often found on
rocks and stones in quickly flowing streams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Helminthocladiaceæ.</b> Tetraspores are generally
wanting (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Nemalion</i>) or arise one in each
tetrasporangium (<i>e.g. Batrachospermum</i>) and it
is only in <i>Liagora</i> that four cruciate tetraspores are
formed. <i>Chantransia corymbifera</i> consists of simple,
branched cell-rows, and is an independent species. Several
other <i>Chantransia-forms</i>, living in fresh water, are
“proembryos” of species of the genus <i>Batrachospermum</i>.
The germinating carpospore grows out into filaments and forms
a so-called proembryo which, if not shaded, attains only a
small size, but when growing in shady situations presents a
much greater development. These highly developed proembryos
have been described as species of <i>Chantransia</i>. The
proembryo can reproduce by division, or by tetraspores which
are developed singly in the sporangia; in <i>B. vagum</i> and
<i>B. sporulans</i> which do not possess fully developed female
reproductive organs, the proembryos serve almost entirely to
reproduce the species. The young <i>Batrachospermum</i>-plant
arises from the end of an upright filament of the proembryo.
The proembryo is generally persistent, and continually produces
new <i>Batrachospermums</i>. These latter bear the sexual
reproductive organs and also whorls of branches: the central
row of cells is enclosed by cells growing from the base of the
whorls of branches, and from these cortical cells secondary
proembryos are developed. In this alternation of shoots there is
really no alternation of generations, since the proembryo and
the shoots with the sexual reproductive organs are parts of the
same thallus.</p>

<p>Several species of <i>Batrachospermum</i> have a bluish green
or verdigris colour. <i>Nemalion multifidum</i> has a brown-red
thallus, slightly branched, which is attached to rocks near the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Chætangiaceæ.</b> <i>Galaxaura</i> has a thallus
thickly incrusted with lime.</p>

<p>Order 4. <b>Gelidiaceæ.</b> <i>Naccaria, Gelidium.</i></p>

<p>Sub-Family 2. <b>Gigartinales.</b> The fertilised auxiliary
cell grows towards the thallus, to produce the gonimoblasts.
Procarpia generally present.</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Acrotylaceæ.</b> <i>Acrotylus.</i></p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Gigartinaceæ.</b> <i>Gigartina</i>,
<i>Phyllophora</i>, <i>Ahnfeltia</i>; <i>Chondrus crispus</i>,
with dark red, dichotomously branched thallus, is common on the
coasts of Scandinavia and Great Britain.</p>

<p>Order 7. <b>Rhodophyllidaceæ.</b> <i>Rhodophyllis</i>,
<i>Euthora</i>; <i>Cystoclonium purpurascens</i> is common,
and sometimes the ends of its branches may be modified into
tendril-like haptera.</p>

<p>Sub-Family 3. <b>Rhodymeniales.</b> The fertilised auxiliary
cell forms the gonimoblast on the side away from the thallus.
Procarpia are abundantly produced.</p>

<p>Order 8. <b>Sphærococcaceæ.</b> <i>Gracilaria.</i></p>

<p>Order 9. <b>Rhodymeniaceæ.</b> <i>Rhodymenia palmata</i> is
a common species. <i>Lomentaria</i>, <i>Chylocladia</i>,
<i>Plocamium</i>.</p>

<p>Order 10. <b>Delesseriaceæ.</b> <i>Delesseria sanguinea</i>;
<i>D. alata</i> and <i>D. sinuosa</i> are handsome forms which
are not uncommon.</p>

<p>Order 11. <b>Bonnemaisoniaceæ.</b> <i>Bonnemaisonia.</i></p>

<p>Order 12. <b>Rhodomelaceæ.</b> <i>Rhodomela</i>,
<i>Odonthalia</i>; <i>Polysiphonia</i>, of which many species
are to be found on the coasts of Great Britain, has a
filamentous, richly branched thallus consisting of a central row
of cells surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> by a varying number of cortical cells of
similar size&mdash;the so-called “siphons.”</p>

<p>Order 13. <b>Ceramiaceæ.</b> Pretty Algæ, often branched
dichotomously, or unilaterally pinnate. <i>Spermothamnion,
Griffithsia, Callithamnion, Ceramium, Ptilota.</i></p>

<p>Sub-Family 4. <b>Cryptonemiales.</b> The cells formed by the
coalescence of the auxiliary cells and the ooblastema-filaments,
produce the gonimoblasts. The <i>carpogonium-filaments</i> and
the auxiliary cells are scattered singly in the thallus.</p>

<p>Order 14. <b>Gloiosiphoniaceæ.</b> <i>Gloiopeltis.</i></p>

<p>Order 15. <b>Grateloupiaceæ.</b> <i>Halymenia, Cryptonemia.</i></p>

<p>Order 16. <b>Dumontiaceæ.</b> <i>Dumontia, Dudresnaya.</i></p>

<p>Order 17. <b>Nemastomaceæ.</b> <i>Furcellaria</i>, which has
dichotomously branched, round shoots, is common on the coasts of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Order 18. <b>Rhizophyllidaceæ.</b> <i>Polyides, Rhizophyllis.</i></p>

<p>Order 19. <b>Squamariaceæ.</b> The Algæ belonging to this order
form crust-like coverings on stones, mussel-shells, and on other
Algæ, but are not themselves incrustated: <i>Petrocelis</i>,
<i>Cruoria</i>, <i>Peyssonellia</i>.</p>

<p>Order 20. <b>Corallinaceæ.</b> Partly crustaceous, partly
erect, branched Algæ, thickly incrusted with lime, so that a
few species (<i>Lithothamnia</i>, also called <i>Nullipora</i>)
occur in fossilized condition from Jurassic to Tertiary periods.
<i>Melobesia, Lithophyllum, Lithothamnion, Corallina.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> “Carragen” is the thallus of <i>Chondrus crispus</i>
(Irish Moss) and <i>Gigartina mamillosa</i>. It is a common article of
food on the coasts of Ireland, and swells to a jelly when cooked. It
is officinal. <i>Rhodymenia palmata</i> is generally eaten as food in
Ireland and in some places on the west coast of Norway; it is also used
as food for sheep and hence is termed “Sheep-seaweed.” Agar-Agar is the
jelly obtained from species of <i>Gelidium</i> and <i>Gigartina</i>
growing in China and Japan.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="smaller">Sub-Division III. <b>FUNGI.</b></h2>
</div>


<p><b>Mode of Life.</b> The Fungi have no chlorophyll, and are thus
unable in any stage of their existence to assimilate carbon; they
must therefore live as <i>saprophytes</i> or <i>parasites</i>. There
is, however, no strong line of demarcation between these; many Fungi
commence as true parasites, but only attain their full development
upon or in dead plants or animals (<i>Rhytisma</i>, <i>Empusa</i>).
Many saprophytes may occasionally appear as parasites, and are then
designated “<i>facultative parasites</i>” (<i>Nectria cinnabarina</i>,
<i>Lophodermium pinastri</i>), in contradistinction to those which
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> appear as parasites, “<i>obligate parasites</i>” (Mildew,
Brand-and Rust-Fungi, <i>Cordyceps</i>).</p>

<p>The parasites which live on the surface of the host-plant are termed
<i>epiphytic</i> (Mildew, <i>Fusicladium</i>); and those living
in its tissues are termed <i>endophytic</i> (<i>Ustilago</i>,
<i>Peronospora</i>). <i>Epizoic</i> (<i>Oidium tonsurans</i>,
<i>Laboulbenia</i>) and <i>endozoic</i> Fungi (<i>Cordyceps</i>,
<i>Entomophthora</i>), are distinguished, in the same manner, as those
which live on the surface or in the interior of animals. The Fungi
designated <i>pathogenic</i> are especially those which produce disease
in human beings and in animals.</p>

<p>Most of the diseases of plants are attributed to the parasitic Fungi.
These force their way into the host-plant by piercing the outer wall of
the epidermis, as in the Potato-disease; or by growing in through the
stomata, <i>e.g.</i> the summer generations of the Rust of Wheat; or
they can only penetrate through a wound, <i>e.g. Nectria</i>.
Some effect an entrance into the host-plant by the secretion of a
poisonous matter or ferment, which softens and destroys the cell-walls
(<i>Sclerotinia</i>). Some Yeast and Mould Fungi secrete ferments
(enzymes), which, for example, convert cane-sugar into a sugar capable
of fermentation.</p>

<p>The relation of the parasitic Fungus to the host-plant is mainly of
two kinds. In the one case, the cell-contents are destroyed, the
protoplasm is killed, and the cellular tissue becomes discoloured and
dies (<i>Peronospora</i>, <i>Armillaria mellea</i>, <i>Polyporus</i>);
in the other case, the parasite has an irritating effect on the
cellular tissue, whereby the affected organ grows more rapidly and
becomes larger than normal, producing <i>hypertrophy</i>. Such
malformations are termed <i>Fungi-galls</i> (Mycocecidia); in this
manner “witches’ brooms” are produced by <i>Æcidium</i>, “pocket-plum”
by <i>Taphrina</i>, and other deformities by <i>Exobasidium</i> and
<i>Cystopus candidus</i>. This hypertrophy may either be produced by
a vigorous cell-multiplication, which is most frequently the case,
or by the enlargement of the individual cells (<i>Synchytrium</i>,
<i>Calyptospora</i>). The relation between host and Fungus among the
Lichens is of a very peculiar nature, termed “<i>symbiosis</i>.”</p>

<p><b>Vegetative Organs.</b> The vegetative parts of a Fungus are
termed its <i>mycelium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This is formed of a mass of long,
cylindrical, branched cells resembling threads (and hence termed
<i>hyphæ</i>), which have a continued apical growth. The mycelium,
in its early development, shows a well-marked difference between
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> two main groups of true Fungi: in the <i>Phycomycetes</i>, or
Algal Fungi, the mycelium has no transverse walls, and is therefore
unicellular, while in the <i>Mesomycetes</i> and <i>Mycomycetes</i>
it is provided with dividing walls, which gradually arise during
growth, in the youngest hyphæ; intercalary transverse walls may also
be formed at a later period. In the hyphæ of some of the Higher
Fungi (<i>Hymenomycetes</i>), connections may be formed between two
contiguous cells of the same hypha, by a protuberance growing out from
an upper cell just above the transverse wall, and forming a junction
with the cell below. These are known as <i>clamp-connections</i>; they
appear to be of use in affording communication between the two cells.</p>

<p>The hyphæ of Fungi, where they come in contact with one another, often
grow together, so that <b>H</b>-formed combinations (fusions) are
produced, which give rise to very compact felted tissue. When the hyphæ
are not only closely interwoven, but also united and provided with
many transverse walls, the mycelium assumes the appearance of a tissue
with isodiametric cells, and is then termed <i>pseudo-parenchyma</i>.
The hyphæ-walls are sometimes very much thickened, and composed of
several layers, and the external layers, by the absorption of water,
may often swell very much and become mucilaginous. In some instances
the walls are colourless, in others coloured, the most frequent colour
being brown. The cell-contents may also be coloured, and in that case
are generally yellow; this colour is chiefly connected with the fat
(oil) which may be found in abundance in the Fungi, whilst starch is
invariably absent in all the true Fungi.</p>

<p>The mycelium assumes many different forms; sometimes it appears
as a thread-like, cobwebby, loose tissue, less frequently as firm
strands, thin or thick membranes, horn-like plates or tuber-like
bodies. The <i>thread-like</i> mycelium may, in the parasitic Fungi,
be intercellular or intracellular, according as it only extends into
the interstices between the cells or enters into the cells proper.
In the first case there are generally found haustoria, or organs of
suction (<i>e.g.</i> among the <i>Peronosporaceæ</i>; <i>Taphrina</i>,
on the contrary, has no haustoria); but haustoria are also found
among the epiphytic Fungi (<i>e.g.</i> Erysiphaceæ). Intracellular
mycelia are found in the Rust-Fungi, in <i>Claviceps purpurea</i>,
<i>Entomophthora</i>, etc. In spite of its delicate structure, this
mycelium may live a long time, owing to the circumstance that it
continues to grow peripherally, while the older parts gradually die off
(“fairy rings”).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p><i>String-like</i> mycelia may be found, for example, in
<i>Phallus</i>, <i>Coprinus</i>, and are formed of hyphæ, which run
more or less parallel to each other. <i>Membrane-like</i> mycelia
are chiefly to be found in Fungi growing on tree-stems (Polyporaceæ
and Agaricaceæ); they may have a thickness varying from that of the
finest tissue-paper to that of thick leather, and may extend for
several feet. The peculiar horny or leather-like strands and plates
which, for instance, appear in <i>Armillaria mellea</i>, are known as
<i>Rhizomorpha</i>; they may attain a length of more than fifty feet.
The <i>tuber-like</i> mycelia or <i>sclerotia</i> play the part of
resting mycelia, since a store of nourishment is accumulated in them,
and after a period of rest they develope organs of reproduction. The
sclerotia are hard, spherical, or irregular bodies, from the size
of a cabbage seed to that of a hand, internally white or greyish,
with a brown or black, pseudo-parenchymatous, external layer.
Sclerotia only occur in the higher Fungi, and are found both in
saprophytes, <i>e.g. Coprinus</i>, and in parasites, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Claviceps</i> (Ergot), <i>Sclerotinia</i>.</p>

<p><b>Reproduction.</b> <span class="smcap">Sexual reproduction</span> is found only
among the lower Fungi which stand near to the Algæ, the Algal-Fungi,
and takes place by the same two methods as in the Algæ, namely by
<i>conjugation</i> and by the <i>fertilisation</i> of the egg-cell in
the oogonium.</p>

<p>The majority of Fungi have only <span class="allsmcap">ASEXUAL</span> reproduction.
The most important methods of this kind of reproduction are the
<i>sporangio-fructification</i> and the <i>conidio-fructification</i>.</p>

<p>In the <span class="allsmcap">SPORANGIO-FRUCTIFICATION</span> the <i>spores</i> (endospores)
<i>arise inside</i> a mother-cell, the sporangium (Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a>). Spores
without a cell-wall, which move in water by means of cilia and hence
are known as <i>swarmspores</i> or <i>zoospores</i>, are found among
the Oomycetes, the sporangia in which these are produced being called
swarm-sporangia or zoosporangia (Figs. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, <a href="#fig87">87</a>, <a href="#fig91">91</a>, <a href="#fig94">94</a>).</p>

<p>In the <span class="allsmcap">CONIDIO-FRUCTIFICATION</span> the <i>conidia</i> (exospores)
arise on special hyphæ (conidiophores), or directly from the
mycelium. When conidiophores are present, the conidia are developed
upon them terminally or laterally, either in a basipetal succession
(in many Fungi, for example in <i>Penicillium</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig111">111</a>,
<i>Erysiphe</i>, <i>Cystopus</i>), or acropetally (in which method
the chains of conidia are often branched; examples, <i>Pleospora
vulgaris</i>, <i>Hormodendron cladosporioides</i>). All conidia
are at first unicellular, sometimes at a later stage they become
two-celled or multicellular through the formation of partition-walls
(<i>Piptocephalis</i>). The conidia with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> thick, brown cell-walls,
and contents rich in fats (<i>resting conidia</i>), can withstand
unfavourable external conditions for a much longer period than conidia
with thin walls and poor in contents.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SPORANGIA</span> arise either from the ordinary cells of the
mycelium (<i>Protomyces</i>), or are borne on special hyphæ. They are
generally spherical (<i>Mucor</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a>; Saprolegniaceæ), egg-,
pear-, or club-shaped (Ascomycetes), more rarely they are cylindrical
or spindle-shaped. While among the Phycomycetes the size, form, and
number of spores are indefinite in each species, in the Ascomycetes
the sporangia (<i>asci</i>) have a definite size, form, and number of
spores. The spores of the Ascomycetes are known as ascospores.</p>

<p>The sporangio-fructification is found under three main forms.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Free Sporangiophores</span> which are either single (<i>Mucor</i>,
Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>), or branched (<i>Thamnidium</i>).</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Sporangial-layers.</span> These are produced by a number of
sessile or shortly-stalked sporangia, being formed close together like
a palisade (<i>Taphrina</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig105">105</a>).</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Sporangiocarps.</span> These consist usually of many sporangia
enclosed in a covering, they are found only in the Carpoasci, and
are also known as <i>ascocarps</i>. The parts of an ascocarp are the
<i>covering</i> (<i>peridium</i>), and the <i>hymenium</i>, which is
in contact with the inner wall of the peridium, and is generally made
up of asci, and sterile, slender hyphæ. The latter either penetrate
between the asci and are branched and multicellular (<i>paraphyses</i>,
Figs. <a href="#fig103">103</a> <i>d</i>, <a href="#fig123">123</a>, <a href="#fig125">125</a>, <a href="#fig129">129</a>), or clothe those parts of the inner
wall which bear no asci (<i>periphyses</i>; among many peronocarpic
Ascomycetes, <i>e.g. Chætomium</i>, <i>Sordaria</i>,
<i>Stictosphæra hoffmanni</i>). The ascocarps are produced directly
from the mycelium, or from a <i>stroma</i>, that is a vegetative body
of various forms, in which they may be embedded (Figs. <a href="#fig116">116</a> <i>B</i>,
<i>C</i>).</p>

<p>Among the conidio-fructifications there are, in the same way, three
divisions.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Free conidiophores</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig109">109</a>). The form of the
conidiophores, the shape, and number of its spores are various. In the
most highly developed Fungi, the Basidiomycetes, there are, however,
special more highly developed conidiophores, the <i>basidia</i>, which
have a definite form and spores of a definite shape and number. The
conidia borne on basidia are called <i>basidiospores</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Conidial-layers.</span> (<i>a</i>) The <span class="allsmcap">SIMPLEST</span>
case of this is found when the conidiophores arise directly from
the mycelium, parallel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> to one another, and form a flat body
(<i>e.g. Exobasidium vaccinii</i>, <i>Hypochnus</i>; among the
Phycomycetes, <i>Empusa muscæ</i> and <i>Cystopus</i>). (<i>b</i>)
In a <span class="allsmcap">HIGHER</span> form the conidial-layers are thick, felted
threads (<i>stroma</i>) inserted between the mycelium and the
<i>hymenium</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the region of the conidiophores). Examples
are found in a section of the Pyrenomycetes (Fig. <a href="#fig122">122</a>). (<i>c</i>)
The <span class="allsmcap">HIGHEST</span> form has the <i>basidial-layer</i>, that is a
conidial-layer with more highly developed conidiophores (basidia). The
basidial-layer, with stroma, and the hymenium (region of the basidia),
forms the basidio-fructification, which is branched in the Clavariaceæ,
and hat-shaped in other Hymenomycetes (in these groups the hymenium is
confined to the lower side of the pileus).</p>

<p>The hymenium of the conidial-layer and basidial-layer is composed
entirely of conidiophores, or of conidiophores and sterile hyphæ
(<i>paraphyses</i>) which are probably always unicellular. Paraphyses
are found in <i>Entomophthora radicans</i>, and in certain
Basidiomycetes (<i>e.g. Corticium</i>).</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Conidiocarps</span> (<i>pycnidia</i>). A special covering
surrounds the conidia-forming elements. The inner side of this covering
(<i>peridium</i>) bears the hymenium, <i>i.e.</i> those elements
from which the conidia are abstricted. The conidiocarps arise either
immediately from the hyphæ or from a <i>stroma</i> in which they
are generally embedded. Conidiocarps are entirely wanting in the
Phycomycetes. On the other hand they are found among the Ascomycetes
and Basidiomycetes, and in the latter group the conidiocarps contain
more highly differentiated conidiophores (basidia) and are known
as <i>basidiocarps</i>. Conidiocarps with simple conidiophores,
are found only among the Basidiomycetes, in the Uredinaceæ, and in
<i>Craterocolla cerasi</i>. In the Ascomycetes (Figs. <a href="#fig120">120</a> <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>; <a href="#fig117">117</a> <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; <a href="#fig123">123</a> <i>a</i>; <a href="#fig124">124</a> <i>b</i>)
the conidiocarps are visible, as points, to the naked eye, while
the basidiocarps of the Basidiomycetes (Figs. <a href="#fig170">170</a>, <a href="#fig171">171</a>, <a href="#fig173">173–176</a>,
<a href="#fig178">178–180</a>) vary from the size of a pea to that of a child’s head. The
“spermogonia” of the Ascomycetes and Lichenes, are conidiocarps with
small conidia (<i>microconidia</i>) which germinate sometimes more
slowly than other conidia, and formerly were erroneously considered as
male reproductive cells, and called spermatia.</p>

<p>The conidia of the Fungi are not primitive structures. The comparison
of the sporangia and conidia among the Zygomycetes, and among the
species of the genus <i>Peronospora</i> shows, that the conidia
are aberrant formations, and that they have arisen through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> the
degeneration of the sporangium, which, by the reduction of its spores
to one, has itself become a spore.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the genera <i>Thamnidium</i> and <i>Chætocladium</i>
the gradual diminution of the sporangia, and the reduction
of the number of spores can be distinctly followed. In
<i>Thamnidium</i> the number of spores is often reduced to one,
which is <i>free</i> in the sporangium. In <i>Chætocladium</i>
however the sporangia are typically <i>one-spored</i>, the
spore is always united with the sporangium, and the two
become a single body, the so-called <i>conidium</i>, which is
in reality a closed sporangium. How close is the connection
between the sporangia and conidia of <i>Thamnidium</i> and
<i>Chætocladium</i>, is seen from the fact that, in the
conidial stage of <i>Chætocladium</i> the same whorl-form of
branching appears as in the sporangial stages of <i>Thamnidium
chætocladioides</i>, and also, that the conidia of <i>Ch.
fresenianum</i> throw off the former sporangium-wall
(exosporium), while <i>Ch. jonesii</i> germinates without
shedding its exosporium. The Phycomycetes have doubtless
sprung from Water-Algæ and inherit the sporangia from them. On
this supposition, as the Phycomycetes assumed a terrestrial
mode of life, the sporangia would become adapted to the
distribution of the spores by means of the air, the sporangia
would become small, contain dust-like spores, and would
eventually become closed-sporangia, <i>i.e.</i> conidia. The
conidia are a terrestrial method for the multiplication of
Fungi. In the Hemiasci and the Ascomycetes the sporangia are
still preserved, but in every instance they are adapted to
terrestrial spore-distribution, their spores being set free
on the destruction of the sporangium-wall (generally shot
out) and distributed through the air. For further examples of
spore-distribution see below, p. <a href="#Page_91">91–93</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The reproduction of Fungi is accomplished not only by spores and
conidia, but also sometimes by <i>chlamydospores</i>. These are
fundaments<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of sporangiophores and conidiophores, which have
taken on a resting condition in the form of a spore, and are able
to germinate and produce carpophores. In the formation of the
chlamydospores the hyphæ accumulate reserve materials at the expense
of the neighbouring cells; in the undivided hyphæ of the Phycomycetes
transverse walls are formed, and finally the chlamydospores are
set free by the decay of the empty cells connecting them with the
mycelium. One must distinguish between <i>oidia</i> and <i>true
chlamydospores</i>. The former are more simple, the latter are a
somewhat more differentiated form of carpophore fundaments, which serve
for propagation in the same manner as spores. In <i>Chlamydomucor
racemosus</i> the chlamydospores grow out into the air and form
differentiated carpophores. In the Autobasidiomycetes they only
germinate vegetatively, and not with the formation of fructifications.
From <i>Chlamydomucor</i> up to the Autobasidiomycetes the successive
development of the fructification,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> which is interrupted by the
formation of the chlamydospores, degenerates more and more. Among
certain Ustilagineæ the chlamydospores (brand-spores) no longer
germinate with the production of fructifications. In the Uredinaceæ,
only one of the three chlamydospore-forms has the property of producing
fructifications on germination; the other forms only germinate
vegetatively, like ordinary spores, and in the same manner as the
chlamydospores of the Autobasidiomycetes. In the Hemibasidii, and the
Uredinaceæ, in <i>Protomyces</i>, the chlamydospores are the chief
means of reproduction. They are found also among the Ascomycetes.</p>

<p>The sporangia and the conidia of the Fungi have their common origin
in the sporangia of the Phycomycetes. The asci (and the Ascomycetes
which are characterised by these bodies) are descended from the
sporangia-forming, lower Fungi; the basidia (and the Basidiomycetes)
from those which bear conidia. <i>The sporangia of the Phycomycetes
are the primitive form and the starting point for all the reproductive
forms of the Fungi.</i> The chlamydospores appear besides in all
classes of Fungi as supplementary forms of reproduction, and are of
no importance in determining relationships. Although the expression
“fruit” must essentially be applied to true Phanerogams, yet, through
usage, the term “<i>fruit-forms</i>,” is employed to designate the
forms or means of reproduction of Fungi, and the organs of reproduction
are known as <i>organs of fructification</i>, the sporangiophores and
conidiophores as <i>fruit-bearers</i> (<i>carpophores</i>), and the
sporangiocarps, conidiocarps, and basidiocarps as “<i>fruit-bodies</i>.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The majority of Fungi have more than one method of reproduction,
often on various hosts (Uredinaceæ). Species with one, two,
or more than two methods of reproduction are spoken of as
having monomorphic, dimorphic, or pleomorphic fructification.
Monomorphic, <i>e.g.</i> the Tuberaceæ; dimorphic, <i>Mucor</i>,
<i>Piptocephalis</i>, Saprolegniaceæ, <i>Penicillium
crustaceum</i>; pleomorphic, <i>Puccinia graminis</i>,
<i>Capnodium salicinum</i> (in the last species there are five
methods of reproduction: yeast-like conidia, free conidiophores,
conidiocarps with small and large conidia, and ascocarps).</p>
</div>

<p><b>The liberation and distribution of the spores and conidia.</b> The
spores and conidia, on account of their small size and lightness, are
spread far and wide by currents in the air, but in addition to this
method, insects and other animals frequently assist in disseminating
them. The liberation of the conidia is occasionally effected by the
complete shrinking away of the conidiophore, but more frequently by
abstriction from the conidiophores, either by their gradually tapering
to a point, or by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> dissolution of a cross-wall (generally of a
mucilaginous nature). The individual links of conidia-chains are
detached from one another in the same way, or often by means of small,
intercalary cells, which are formed at the base of the individual
links, and becoming slimy, dissolve upon the maturity of the spores.
Special contrivances for ejecting the spores and conidia may often
be found. In <i>Peronospora</i> the cylindrical fruit-hyphæ in the
dry condition become strap-shaped and also twisted. These are very
hygroscopic, and the changes of form take place so suddenly, that
the spores are violently detached and shot away. In <i>Empusa</i> a
peculiar squirting mechanism may be found (Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>). Each club-shaped
hypha which projects from the body of the fly, bears a conidium at its
apex; a vacuole, which grows gradually larger, is formed in the slimy
contents of the hypha, and the pressure thereby eventually becomes so
great that the hypha bursts at its apex, and the conidium is shot into
the air. By a similar mechanism, the spores of many of the Agaricaceæ
are cast away from the parent-plants. In the case of <i>Pilobolus</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a>) the entire sporangium is thrown for some distance into the
air by a similar contrivance, the basal region of the sporangium
having, by the absorption of water, been transformed into a slimy layer
which is readily detached. <i>Sphærobolus</i>, a Gasteromycete, has
a small, spherical fruit-body (basidiocarp), the covering of which,
when ripe, suddenly bursts, and the basidiospores contained in it are
forcibly ejected.</p>

<p><i>The spores which are enclosed in asci</i> are, in some instances,
set free from the mother-cell (ascus) prior to their complete
development (<i>Elaphomyces</i>, <i>Eurotium</i>). In the case of the
majority of the Pyrenomycetes and Truffles, the asci swell by the
absorption of water into a slimy mass, which gradually disappears,
so that the spores lie free in the fruit-body; they either remain
there till the fruit-body decays, as in those which have no aperture
(Perisporiaceæ, Tuberaceæ), or the slimy mass, by its growth, is
forced out through the aperture of the sporocarp, taking the spores
with it (<i>Nectria</i>). The ejection of the spores by mechanical
means takes place in a number of Ascomycetes, and should many spores
be simultaneously ejected, a dust-cloud may be seen with the naked
eye to arise in the air from the fruit-body. This is the case in the
larger species of <i>Peziza</i>, <i>Helvella</i>, <i>Rhytisma</i>,
when suddenly exposed to a damp current of air. A distinction is
drawn between a simultaneous ejection of all the spores contained in
the ascus, and an ejection at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> intervals (successive), when only one
spore at a time is thrown out. The first of these methods is the most
frequent, and is brought about by the ascus being lined with a layer of
protoplasm, which absorbs water to such a degree that the elastic walls
are extended at times to double their original size. The spores are
forced up against the free end of the ascus, a circular rupture is made
at this point, and the elastic walls contract, so that the fluid with
the spores is ejected. Special means may in some instances be found
to keep the spores together, and compel their simultaneous ejection.
Thus, a tough slime may surround all the spores (<i>Saccobolus</i>),
or a chain-apparatus, similarly formed of tough slime; or there may
be a hooked appendage from each end of the spores which hooks into
the appendage of the next spore (<i>Sordaria</i>). The paraphyses
occurring between the asci in many Ascomycetes, also play a part
in the distribution of the spores, by reason of the pressure they
exercise. The asci in some of the Pyrenomycetes, which are provided
with jar-shaped fruit-bodies, elongate to such an extent that, without
becoming detached from their bases, they reach the mouth of the
fruit-body one at a time, burst and disperse their spores, and so make
room for those succeeding. An ejection of the spores at intervals from
the ascus is rarer. It takes place, for instance, in <i>Pleospora</i>,
whose asci have a double wall. The external wall, by absorption of
water, at last becomes ruptured, and the internal and more elastic
membrane forces itself out in the course of a few seconds to one of two
or three times greater length and thickness, so that one spore after
another is forcibly ejected from a narrow aperture at the end of the
ascus.</p>

<p><b>Germination of spores</b> (conidia and chlamydospores). In many
spores may be found one or more <i>germ-pores</i>, <i>i.e.</i> thinner
places, either in the inner membrane (uredospores, <i>Sordaria</i>) or
in the external membrane (teleutospores in Rust-Fungi), through which
the germination takes place. Generally this does not occur till the
spores have been set free: in some Ascomycetes germination commences
inside the ascus (<i>Taphrina</i>, <i>Sclerotinia</i>). The different
ways in which the spores germinate may be classified into three groups.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The ordinary germination</span> occurs by the spore emitting a
germ-tube, which immediately developes into a mycelium. In spores with
a double wall it is only the inner membrane which forms the germ-tube.
In swarmspores a single wall is formed after the withdrawal of the
cilia, and this, by direct elongation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> becomes the germ-tube. The
protoplasm accumulated in the spore enters the hypha, which, in pure
water, can only grow as long as the reserve nourishment lasts.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">Germination with promycelium</span> differs only by the
circumstance that the hypha developed from the germ-tube has a very
limited growth, and hence it does not immediately develope into a
mycelium, but produces conidia (Rust-and Brand-Fungi). This promycelium
must only be regarded as an advanced development of a conidiophore or
basidium.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <span class="smcap">The yeast-formation</span> of conidia consists in the
production of outgrowths, very much constricted at their bases,
from one or more places. Each of the conidia formed in this manner
may again germinate in the same way. When sufficient nourishment
is present, a branched chain of such conidia is formed, and these
are finally detached from one another. Yeast-like buddings from the
conidia are produced in various Fungi, <i>e.g. Ascoidea</i>,
<i>Protomyces</i>, Ustilagineæ, Ascomycetes, Tremellaceæ, etc. In the
Ustilagineæ these conidia are an important element in the development.
The budding conidia of <i>Exobasidium</i> forms a “mould” on the
nutritive solution. The yeast-like conidia are not to be confounded
with the “Mucor-yeast” (comp. Mucoraceæ). For <i>Saccharomyces</i> see
Appendix to the Fungi, page <a href="#Page_176">176</a>.</p>

<p>In a compound spore (<i>i.e.</i> when a mass of spores are associated
together) each spore germinates on its own account. There are
sometimes, however, certain among them which do not germinate, but
yield their contents to those which do.</p>

<p>The <i>length of time</i> for which conidia can retain their power
of germination is shortest (being only a few weeks) in those having
thin walls and containing a large supply of water (Peronosporaceæ,
Uredinaceæ). In many spores a resting period is absolutely necessary
before they are able to germinate (resting spores). It has been
observed in some spores and conidia, that the faculty of germinating
may be preserved for several years if the conditions necessary
for germination remain absent (Ustilagineæ, <i>Eurotium</i>,
<i>Penicillium</i>).</p>

<p>The optimum, minimum and maximum temperatures required for the
germination of the spores has been decided in the case of a good many
Fungi. A large portion of the most common Fungi have their optimum at
20°C., minimum at 1–2°C, maximum at 40°C. In the case of pathogenic
Fungi the optimum is adapted to the temperature of the blood. Fungi
living in manure, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> spores are often adapted to germinate in
the alimentary canals of warm-blooded animals, have an optimum
corresponding to the temperature of these animals, but with a little
margin.</p>

<p><b>Systematic Division.</b>&mdash;The lowest class of the Fungi is that
of the <span class="smcap">Phycomycetes</span>, which have an unicellular mycelium,
sexual and asexual reproduction, and have doubtless sprung from
sporangia-bearing, lower Green Algæ. From the Phycomycetes (and
certainly from the Zygomycetes) spring two well defined branches,
each with numerous distinct species; to the one branch belong
the <span class="smcap">Hemiasci</span> and the <span class="smcap">Ascomycetes</span>, to the other
the <span class="smcap">Hemibasidii</span> and the BASIDIOMYCETES. Ascomycetes and
Basidiomycetes may be united under the title of <span class="smcap">Mycomycetes</span> or
<span class="smcap">Higher Fungi</span>. The Hemiasci and the Hemibasidii constitute the
class of <span class="smcap">Mesomycetes</span>. The Hemiasci are an intermediate form
between Zygomycetes and Ascomycetes; the Hemibasidii a similar group
between the Zygomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Mesomycetes and Mycomycetes
have only asexual reproduction; sexual reproduction is wanting. Their
mycelium is multicellular.</p>

<p>Up to the present time about 39,000 species have been described.</p>

<h3>Class 1. <b>Phycomycetes (Algal-Fungi).</b><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h3>

<p>This group resembles <i>Vaucheria</i> and the other Siphoneæ among the
Algæ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Organs of Nutrition.</span> The mycelium is formed of a single
cell, often thread-like and abundantly branched (Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>). Vegetative
propagation by chlamydospores and oidia. Asexual reproduction by
endospores (sometimes <i>swarmspores</i>) and conidia. Sexual
reproduction by conjugation of two hyphæ as in the Conjugatæ, or
by fertilisation of an egg-cell in an oogonium. On this account
the class of the Phycomycetes is divided into two sub-classes:
<span class="smcap">Zygomycetes</span> and <span class="smcap">Oomycetes</span>.</p>


<h3 class="smaller">Sub-Class I. <b>Zygomycetes.</b></h3>

<p>Sexual reproduction takes place by zygospores, which function as
resting-spores, and arise in consequence of <i>conjugation</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig81_82">81</a>); in the majority of species these are rarely found, and only
under special conditions. The most common method of reproduction is
by endospores, by acrogenous conidia, by chlamydospores, or by oidia.
<i>Swarmspores are wanting.</i> Parasites and saprophytes (order 6
and 7). The zygospores are generally produced when the formation
of sporangia has ceased; <i>e.g.</i> by the suppression of the
sporangial-hyphæ (<i>Mucor mucedo</i>), or by the diminution of oxygen;
<i>Pilobolus crystallinus</i> forms zygospores, when the sporangia are
infected with saprophytic <i>Piptocephalis</i> or <i>Pleotrachelus</i>.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Asexual reproduction only by sporangia.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Mucoraceæ.</b> The spherical sporangia contain many spores.
The zygospore is formed between two unicellular branches (gametes).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>The unicellular mycelium (Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>) of the Mucoraceæ branches
abundantly, and lives, generally, as a saprophyte on all sorts
of dead organic remains. Some of these Fungi are known to be
capable of producing <i>alcoholic fermentation</i>, in common with
the Saccharomyces. This applies especially to <i>Chlamydomucor
racemosus</i> (<i>Mucor racemosus</i>), when grown in a saccharine
solution, and deprived of oxygen; the mycelium, under such conditions,
becomes divided by transverse walls into a large number of small cells.
Many of these swell out into spherical or club-shaped cells, and when
detached from one another become chlamydospores, which abstrict new
cells of similar nature (Fig. 79). These chlamydospores were formerly
erroneously termed “mucor-yeast,” but they must not be confounded with
the yeast-conidia (page 94). They are shortened hyphæ, and are not
conidia of definite size, shape, and point of budding. Oidia are also
found in <i>Chlamydomucor</i>.</p>

<p>The Mucoraceæ, in addition to the chlamydospores and oidia, have a more
normal and ordinary method of reproduction; viz., by <i>spores</i>
which are formed without any sexual act. <i>Mucor</i> has round
sporangia; from the mycelium one or more long branches, sometimes
several centimetres in length, grow vertically into the air; the apex
swells (Figs. <a href="#fig78">78</a>, <a href="#fig80">80</a>) into a sphere which soon becomes separated
from its stalk by a transverse wall; in the interior of this sphere
(sporangium) a number of spores are formed which eventually are set
free by the rupture of the wall. The transverse wall protrudes into
the sporangium and forms the well-known columella (Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a> <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>). The formation of spores takes place in various ways among
the different genera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sexual Reproduction</span> by conjugation takes place in the
following manner. The ends of two hyphæ meet (Fig. <a href="#fig81_82">81</a>) and become
more or less club-shaped; the ends of each of these are cut off by a
cell-wall, and two new small cells (Fig. <a href="#fig81_82">81</a> <i>A</i>) are thus formed,
these coalesce and give rise to a new cell which becomes the very
thick-walled zygote (zygospore), and germinates after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> period of rest,
producing a new hypha, which bears a sporangium (Fig. <a href="#fig81_82">81</a> <i>E</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mucor mucedo</i>, Pin-mould, resembles somewhat in appearance
<i>Penicillium crustaceum</i> and is found growing upon various organic
materials (bread, jam, dung, etc.).</p>

<p><i>Pilobolus</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig83">83</a>, <a href="#fig84">84</a>) grows on manure. Its sporangium (Fig.
<a href="#fig84">84</a> <i>a″</i>) is formed during the night and by a peculiar mechanism
(page <a href="#Page_92">92</a>) is shot away from the plant in the course of the day. This
generally takes place in the summer, between eight and ten a.m. The
sporangium is shot away to a height which may be 300 times greater than
that of the plant itself, and by its stickiness it becomes attached to
portions of plants, etc., which are in the vicinity. If these are eaten
by animals, the spores pass into the alimentary canal and are later
on, sometimes even in a germinating condition, passed out with the
excrement, in which they form new mycelia.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Asexual reproduction by conidia only.</p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Entomophthorales.</b></h4>

<p>The mycelium is richly branched. The family is a transitional step to
the conidia-bearing Zygomycetes, since the oospores of many members of
this family arise, and are formed, like zygospores.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Entomophthoraceæ.</b> Mycelium abundantly developed. This
most frequently lives parasitically in living insects, causing their
death. The conidiophores forming the conidial-layer project from the
skin, and abstrict a proportionately large conidium which is ejected
with considerable force, and by this means transferred to other
insects. These become infected by the entrance of the germ-tube into
their bodies. The spherical, brown resting-spores develope inside the
bodies of insects and germinate by emitting a germ-tube.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Genera</span>: <i>Empusa</i> has a good many species which
are parasitic on flies, moths, grasshoppers, plant-lice. The
conidia emit a germ-tube which pierces the skin of the insect; a
number of secondary conidia are then produced inside its body,
by division or by gemmation similar to that taking place in
yeast, each of which grows and becomes a long unbranched hypha,
and these eventually fill up the body of the animal, causing
distension and death. Each of these hyphæ projects through the
skin, and abstricts a conidium, which is ejected by a squirting
contrivance. The best known species is <i>E. muscæ</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig85">85</a>), which makes its appearance epidemically towards autumn on
the common house-fly, and shows itself by the dead flies which
are found on the windows and walls attached by their probosces,
distended wings, and legs. They have swollen abdomen, broad
white belts of hyphæ between the abdominal rings, and are
surrounded by a circle of whitish dust formed by the ejected
conidia.&mdash;<i>Entomophthora</i> sends out, at definite places,
from the mycelium hidden in the insect’s body, bundles of hyphæ,
which serve the purpose of holding fast the dead insects, the
ramifications attaching themselves to the substratum: the
conidiophores are branched, the conidia are ejected by the
divisional walls between the hyphæ and the conidia dividing into
two layers, those which terminate the hyphæ suddenly expanding
and throwing the conidia into the air. <i>E. radicans</i> makes
its appearance epidemically on caterpillars.</p>
</div>

<p><b>B.</b> Asexual reproduction by zoospores or conidia.</p>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Chytridiales.</b></h4>

<p>In this family the mycelium is very sparsely developed or is
wanting. The entire plant consists principally or entirely of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
single zoosporangium whose zoospores have generally one cilium. The
resting-spores arise either directly from the zoosporangium, which,
instead of forming zoospores, surrounds itself by a thick cell-wall; or
they are formed by the conjugation of two cells (in which case they are
spoken of as oospores). Microscopic Fungi, parasitic on water plants
(especially Algæ) or small aquatic animals, seldom on land plants.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Olpidiaceæ.</b> Without mycelium. Swarmspores and
resting-spores.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the <i>Olpidieæ</i>, the swarmspores, probably, most
frequently form themselves into a plasmodium (naked mass of
protoplasm) which may become a single zoosporangium or a resting
sporangium. <i>Olpidium trifolii</i> occurs in <i>Trifolium
repens</i>.&mdash;In the <i>Synchytrieæ</i> the plasmodium emerging
from the swarmspores breaks up either at once, or after a
period of rest, into smaller plasmodia, each of which will
become a zoosporangium. <i>Synchytrium anemones</i> is found on

nourishment from them. Both oospores and conidia germinate either
immediately, or they develope into sporangia with swarmspores, having
always two cilia. Only one oospore is formed in each oogonium; its
contents (Fig. <a href="#fig89">89</a>) divide into a centrally placed egg-cell and the
“periplasm” surrounding it; this is of a paler colour and on the
maturity of the oospore forms its thick, brown, external covering.</p>

<p><i>The Potato-fungus</i> (<i>Phytophthora infestans</i>) is of great
interest. Its thallus winters in the Potato-tuber; other organs for
passing the winter, such as oospores, are not known. When the tuber
germinates, the Fungus-hyphæ penetrate the young shoot and keep pace
with the aerial growth and development of the plant. The conidiophores
emerge through the stomata, especially on the under side of the leaves;
they branch like a tree (Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>), and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> appear to the naked eye as a
fine mould on the surface of the plant. The disease soon makes itself
known by the brown colouring of those parts of the plant which are
attacked, and by their withering. An ovoid conidium arises at first
by the formation of a dividing wall at the apex of each branch of
the conidiophore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a> <i>c c</i>), and immediately underneath
it another is formed, which pushes the first to one side, and so on.
These conidia sometimes germinate directly, and form a mycelium, but
most frequently their protoplasm divides into many small masses, each
of which becomes a pear-shaped zoospore provided with two cilia (Fig.
<a href="#fig91">91</a>). Water is required for their germination, and when the ripe conidia
are placed in a drop of water the swarm-cells are formed in the course
of about five hours. They swarm about in rain and dewdrops in the
Potato-fields, and are carried with the water to the Potato-plants
and to the tubers in the soil. The wind also very easily conveys
the conidia to healthy Potato-fields and infects them. The enormous
quantity of conidia and swarm-cells that may be formed in the course of
a summer explains the rapid spreading of the disease; and the preceding
makes it clear why wet summers are favourable to its existence. When
the swarm-cells germinate, they round off, and then surround themselves
with a cell-wall which grows out into the germ-tube, and <i>pierces
through the epidermis</i> of the host-plant (Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>). Having entered
the host, a new mycelium is formed. The potato disease, since 1845, has
been rampant in Europe; it has, no doubt, been introduced from America,
which, it must be remembered, is the home of the Potato-plant.</p>

<h3 class="smaller">Sub-Class 2. <b>Hemibasidii, Brand-Fungi.</b></h3>

<p>The Brand-Fungi (also known as <span class="smcap">Ustilagineæ</span>) are Fungi with
<i>basidia-like conidiophores</i>, which, however, have not yet
advanced to a definite form or number of conidia. They are true
parasites, whose mycelium spreads itself in the intercellular spaces of
Flowering plants. The mycelium is colourless, quickly perishable, has
transverse walls at some distance from each other (Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>), and sends
out haustoria into the cells of the host-plant.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig96" style="width: 550px">

  </div>

<p>It most frequently happens that the germ-tube enters the host-plant at
its most tender age, that is, during the germination of the seed; the
mycelium then wanders about in the tissues of the shoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> during its
growth, until it reaches that part of the plant where the spores are to
be formed. The spore-formation takes place in the same way in all those
species whose brand-spores are developed in the floral parts of the
host-plant. Many Brand-Fungi have, however, a more local occurrence,
and the mycelium is restricted to a smaller area of the leaf or stem.
Those organs of the host-plant in which the brand-spores are developed
often become strongly hypertrophied. In perennial plants the mycelium
winters very often in the rhizome.</p>

  </div>

<p>The brand-spores are the winter resting-spores of the Brand-Fungi.
They arise in the tissues of the host-plant, which is often destroyed,
and become free through the rupture of the epidermis; they are
thick-walled, generally brown or violet, and very often possess warts,
spines, or reticulate markings. Fruit-bodies, that is enclosed organs
of reproduction, are found in few genera (<i>Sphacelotheca</i>,
<i>Graphiola</i>; <i>Doassansia</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig97">97</a>). In <i>Tolyposporium</i>,
<i>Tuburcinia</i>, <i>Thecaphora</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig102">102</a>), etc., the
brand-spores are united into a <i>ball of spores</i>. On germination
the brand-spores behave as <i>chlamydospores</i>, namely, as the
fundament of conidiophores, by emitting a short germ-tube, <i>i.e.</i>
a conidiophore (“promycelium”). The <span class="smcap">Ustilaginaceæ</span> (Fig.
<a href="#fig99">99</a>, 2) have a short <i>transversely divided</i> conidiophore,
with <i>laterally</i> developed conidia (comp. the basidia of the
Protobasidiomycetes). The conidiophores of the <span class="smcap">Tilletiaceæ</span> are
undivided (unicellular promycelia), and bear the conidia terminally,
and so resemble the basidia of the Autobasidiomycetes.</p>

<p>In <i>Tilletia</i>, <i>Entyloma</i>, <i>Neovossia</i>,
<i>Tuburcinia</i>, the brand-spores germinate and form
basidia-like conidiophores with spindle-shaped conidia; their
mycelium, on the other hand, produces later only single,
sickle-shaped conidia, so that two kinds of conidia are found,
as in a few Basidiomycetes. In some species, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Ustilago hordei</i>, the brand-spores only germinate
vegetatively and form a mycelium. In nutritive solutions
(solutions of dung, etc.) where they live as <i>saprophytes</i>,
the brand-spores of many species emit germ-tubes, and on these,
<i>yeast-like conidia</i> are produced by repeated budding,
which grow into mycelia only when the nutritive solution is
exhausted. These conidia have not the power of producing
alcoholic fermentation. The very numerous conidia, which are
found in the dung of herbivorous animals, are probably the
yeast-conidia of Brand-Fungi. The brand-spores, which are
eaten by animals with the grain and hay, pass into the dung
and without doubt give rise to a very rich multiplication of
yeast-conidia.</p>

<p>The conidia (also called “sporidia”) of many species unite
generally into an H-form (Figs. <a href="#fig97">97</a>, 4; <a href="#fig100">100</a> h; <a href="#fig101">101</a>, 4). This
union in pairs does not, however, take place with a view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> to
germination, there is no fusion of nuclei, and therefore in this
“fusion” there is no sexual act.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Ustilaginaceæ.</b> Conidiophores with transverse
walls and lateral conidia.&mdash;<i>Ustilago</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig99">99</a>) generally
developes its spores in the floral organs of its host-plant, the
ovary or anthers, where they arise from hyphæ, and form a slimy
mass which when mature becomes a black dust.</p>

<p>To this order belong <i>U. avenæ</i>, parasitic on Oats,
<i>U. hordei</i> and <i>U. nuda</i> (<i>U. jenseni</i>), on
Barley; these are the usual cause of “Smut” on cereals. <i>U.
hypodytes</i> on straw of <i>Elymus</i> and <i>Agropyrum</i>.
<i>U. filiformis</i> in the leaves of <i>Glyceria</i>. <i>U.

<i>Carex</i> into black, dusty balls. <i>U. violacea</i>
developes its violet spore-powder in the anthers of the
Caryophyllaceæ. <i>U. tragopogonis</i>, transforms entire
inflorescences of <i>Tragopogon</i> into a black-violet mass.
Among the largest are <i>U. grandis</i>, which causes the large
swollen nodes in the stem of <i>Phragmites</i>, and the Maize
Blight, <i>U. maydis</i>, which produces outgrowths about the
size of a hand on the spadix of the Maize.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Tilletiaceæ.</b> Conidiophores undivided, generally
several conidia arise at their apices.&mdash;<i>Tilletia tritici</i>,
the <i>Stinkbrand on Wheat</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig100">100</a>). The mycelium lives
in Wheat-plants, producing its spores in the ovary after the
whole interior of this body has been destroyed by the mycelium,
with the exception of the external layer of the wall of the
ovary, which remains essentially unaltered and encloses the
closely packed, firm mass of spores (Fig. 100 <i>d</i>). The
grains of Wheat thus attacked are shorter and thicker than the
sound ones, and the ears show the presence of this Fungus by
their erect position, and the wide separation of the chaff (Fig.
<a href="#fig100">100</a> <i>a</i>). The unpleasant odour of the ovary prior to the
ripening of the spores, has given the name “Stinkbrand,” and,
in like manner, its hardness when it encloses the ripe spores,
is the reason of its being also called “Stonebrand.” On account
of this hardness, the diseased grains are readily harvested
together with the healthy ones, which become infected by the
spores at the threshing. <i>T. lævis</i> (<i>T. fœtens</i>) also
occurs on Wheat and has smooth brand-spores.</p>

<h3>Class 3. <b>Mycomycetes, Higher Fungi.</b></h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mycomycetes</span> are not entirely aquatic in habit; they have
hyphæ with <i>transverse walls</i>, but <i>no sexual reproductive
organs</i>. The asexual reproduction takes place in very different
ways; by endospores (in asci), conidia, basidiospores, chlamydospores,
and oidia. Swarmspores are never found.</p>

<p>Two chief methods of reproduction may be distinguished, and
hence the class may be divided into two large sub-classes:&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Ascomycetes</span> (with asci), and the <span class="smcap">Basidiomycetes</span> (with
basidia).</p>


<h3 class="smaller">Sub-Class 1. <b>Ascomycetes.</b></h3>

<p>The main characteristic which distinguishes the Ascomycetes is the
<i>ascus</i>; a name given to a sporangium of a definite shape and
size, and containing a definite number of spores. The shape is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
generally club-like or spherical, the number of spores 8 (in some 2, 4,
16 or more), see Figs. <a href="#fig103">103</a>, <a href="#fig105">105</a>, <a href="#fig108">108</a>, <a href="#fig110">110</a>, <a href="#fig113">113</a>, <a href="#fig116">116</a>, <a href="#fig120">120</a>, <a href="#fig121">121</a>, <a href="#fig123">123</a>, <a href="#fig129">129</a>.</p>

<p>In the lowest forms, the <span class="smcap">Exoasci</span>, the ascus springs directly
from the mycelium without the formation of a fruit-body (<i>i.e.</i>
ascocarp). In the higher forms, which contain many species, the
<span class="smcap">Carpoasci</span>, the asci are united and form ascocarps which may
be more or less enclosed (angiocarpic, hemiangiocarpic, and probably
gymnocarpic).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig103" style="width: 650px">
     <img
    class="p2"
    src="images/fig103.jpg"
     alt="" />
     <p class="p0 sm"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span>&mdash;Endogenous formation of spores
in <i>Peziza confluens</i>. In the youngest asci there is only one
nucleus (<i>b</i>, <i>e</i>); this divides into two (<i>f</i>); and
the division is repeated so that there are 4 nuclei in <i>c</i> and 8
in <i>g</i>. These surround themselves with protoplasm and a cell-wall
(<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>). The protoplasm of the mother-cell is not entirely
used up.</p>
  </div>

<p>The hyphæ of the <i>Mycelium</i> in some remain free, in others they
are felted together and form thick strands or flat, cushion-like bodies
(compare in particular the stromata of the Pyrenomycetes). Some species
form <i>sclerotia</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig116">116</a>, <a href="#fig128">128</a>).</p>

<p>Asexual reproduction by means of <i>conidia</i> is known in many
species as the principal means of reproduction, and the one which
affords the most rapid means of distribution. The conidia may be
produced on conidiophores (Fig. <a href="#fig109">109</a>), in conidial-layers (Fig. <a href="#fig122">122</a>),
and often in conidiocarps (pycnidia, Figs. <a href="#fig120">120</a> <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
<a href="#fig123">123</a> <i>a</i>; <a href="#fig124">124</a> <i>b.</i>). These last occur partly as the so-called
“spermogonia” (that is, pycnidia with microconidia). The conidiophores
never approach the basidia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In many species the ascospores germinate and form conidia
immediately (<i>Nectria cinnabarina</i>, <i>Sclerotinia</i>,
<i>Taphrina</i>, etc.), sometimes while they are still in
the ascus and before their ejection (<i>Taphrina</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig105">105</a> <i>a</i>). In many instances the conidia by means of
continued budding can, for a longer or shorter time, produce
yeast-conidia, <i>e.g. Taphrina</i>. In many other cases
the conidia arise from the germ-tubes of the ascospores, or at
any part of the mycelium. The unripe asci of <i>Taphrina</i>,
when placed in water, develop conidia at their apices. The
<i>Sclerotinia</i>-species produce numerous conidia whose
germination has never been observed. The formation of conidia
and asci sometimes takes place on the same fruit-body. In
<i>Heterosphæria patella</i> the conidia and asci are developed
successively in the same fruit-body; in the ascocarps of
<i>Dermatea frangula</i> and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> the
formation of conidia may take place. The ascocarps frequently
arise from the conidial-layers (<i>Nectria cinnabarina</i>,
etc.). This relationship of the two forms of reproduction to
each other may be explained by considering that both have
descended phylogenetically from sporangia.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes <i>chlamydospores</i> and <i>oidia</i> also appear in
the Ascomycetes; on germination, however, they do not, as in
<i>Protomyces</i>, form sporangia, and on this account cannot be
distinctly distinguished from conidia.</p>

<p>The asci are morphologically the highest form of reproduction and
are always found at the close of the development of these Fungi; the
accessory forms of reproduction are first developed, but a well-defined
alternation of generations does not occur.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Taphrina</i> are parasites, whose free asci may
be found in great numbers, generally closely pressed together,
on the parts of plants which they have attacked. The asci are
developed directly from the ascogenous cells of a fertile, generally
sub-cuticular, hypha, which arises from the sterile mycelium. The
latter arises from the germinating ascospore, and may hibernate in the
tissues of its host, particularly in the winter buds, and then with
the commencement of the next period of vegetation it continues its
growth side by side with that of its host. The hyphæ ramify in the
intercellular spaces or beneath the cuticle, but have no haustoria. The
ascospores (Fig. <a href="#fig105">105</a> <i>A</i>) and unripe asci may produce conidia.</p>

<p>Very remarkable appearances, and swellings of the attacked
tissues, are produced when the mycelium is perennial; for
example, the “Witches’-brooms” and “Pockets.” The hard,
hollow, stoneless plums, known as “Pocket” or “Bladder” Plums,
are produced by considerable changes in the tissues of the
fruit; these are caused particularly by <i>T. pruni</i> on
several species of <i>Prunus</i>. The “Witches’-brooms,” on
the contrary, are deformations of entire twigs or branches,
and often attain a very large size. They occur on <i>Alnus
incana</i>, caused by <i>T. epiphylla</i>; on <i>Carpinus

when ripe); the fourth and fifth families (<i>Hysteriales</i> and
<i>Discomycetes</i>), on the other hand, are <span class="allsmcap">HEMIANGIOCARPIC</span>
(the ascocarp, here also called an <i>apothecium</i>, is closed in the
early stages, but opens at the commencement of ripening and exposes
a hymenium of crowded asci); the family of <i>Helvellales</i> has
probably <span class="allsmcap">GYMNOCARPIC</span> (or hemiangiocarpic) fruit-bodies.</p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Gymnoascales.</b></h4>

<p>The ascocarps are surrounded by a <i>spongy and incomplete
envelope</i>. One order, poor in species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order <b>Gymnoascaceæ</b>.&mdash;The ascocarps are borne sometimes
solitarily, or sometimes coiled together. <i>Gymnoascus
reessii</i> forms small bodies about 1 mm. in diameter on
old horse-dung, which at first are white and afterwards
orange-red.&mdash;<i>Ctenomyces serratus</i> lives on the old
feathers in birds’ nests.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Perisporiales.</b></h4>

<p>The ascocarps are surrounded by a <i>complete envelope</i> without
any opening: the fruit-bodies are cleistocarpic; the spores are only
liberated after the disintegration of the fruit-bodies. Paraphyses
are wanting. The two first orders have in addition the means of
reproduction by conidia.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Erysiphaceæ, Mildews.</b> The Fungi belonging to this order
are epiphytic parasites, whose mycelium, somewhat resembling a cobweb,
may be seen on the leaves and other green portions of plants (see
Figs. <a href="#fig107">107</a>, <a href="#fig108">108</a>). The hyphæ ramify in all directions upon the surface
of their host, and emit haustoria which penetrate the epidermal cells,
and thus derive the necessary nutriment. The Mildew-Fungi thus belong
to the obligate parasites, and during their growth dwarf and destroy
the portions of their host on which they live. The reproduction takes
place in the first instance by abstriction of conidio-chains from the
end of special branches (Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a> <i>c</i>, a hypha is seen in the act
of detaching a conidium). The conidia may germinate immediately, and
thus quickly reproduce their species. When present in large numbers
they appear as a white meal covering the surface of the plant on which
the fungus is found. Later on appear the dark brown, spheroid ascocarps
(Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a> <i>a</i>) which, although small, are generally just visible
to the naked eye as black specks.</p>

<p>A characteristic feature of the Mildew-Fungi is the thin,
pseudo-parenchymatous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> covering of the ascocarp, enclosing <i>one</i>
(<i>Podosphæra</i> and <i>Sphærotheca</i>; compare <i>Thelebolus</i>
among the Hemiasci) or <i>a few</i> asci (Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a> <i>c</i>),
which do not form any hymenium, but are irregularly placed. The
cells of the ascocarp-envelope are often prolonged into hair-like
appendages. The ascocarps are developed from the mycelium at places
where two hyphæ cross each other (Fig. <a href="#fig107">107</a>). At these places two
short and erect hyphæ are produced side by side. The one from the
lower hypha (Fig. <a href="#fig107">107</a> <i>c</i>) assumes an ellipsoidal shape, and is
known as the <i>archicarp</i> or <i>ascogone</i>, while the other
(“<i>pollinodium</i>”) arches over the ascogone. From the latter
one ascus may be at once developed (<i>Sphærotheca</i>, etc.), or
after its division several asci may be produced, each developed from
one division. The sterile hypha (termed “pollinodium,” since it was
formerly, but erroneously, supposed to fertilise the ascogone) produces
a number of branches, and forms the pseudo-parenchymatous envelope of
one cell in thickness, enclosing the asci.</p>

<p><i>Penicillium crustaceum</i> (<i>P. glaucum</i>, Figs. <a href="#fig111">111</a>, <a href="#fig112">112</a>) is
an exceedingly common “Mould.” Its mycelium appears very frequently on
any organic matter which is permitted to remain untouched, and soon
covers it with a dense mass of blue-green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> conidiophores. These branch
at their summits and bear flask-shaped cells from which the conidia
are abstricted. The ascocarps which, both in size and colour, resemble
grains of sand, have only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> been obtained in luxuriant cultivation with
a limited supply of oxygen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Capnodium salicinum</i> (<i>Fumago salicina</i>,
<i>Cladosporium fumago</i>), a common Mildew, forms dark
overgrowths on the leaves and branches of various shrubs
(Poplars, Elms, Willows) and on Hops. The conidia appear in
various forms, as on conidiophores, in conidiocarps with
large multicellular conidia, and in conidiocarps with small
unicellular conidia; in nutritive solutions yeast-like conidia
are also developed.&mdash;<i>Apiosporium pinophilum</i> produces
mildew on the leaves of <i>Abies alba</i> and <i>Picea
excelsa</i>. (The conidial-forms were formerly described as
“<i>Antennaria pinophila</i>”).</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Tuberaceæ, Truffles.</b> The Fungi belonging to this
order are entirely subterranean. The mycelium is filamentous, and
partly parasitic upon the roots of plants, especially trees, in its
neighbourhood; it is then known as <i>Mycorhiza</i>. The fruit-body
is relatively large, in some cases about the size of a hen’s egg.
Internally it is traversed by a number of winding passages (Fig. <a href="#fig113">113</a>
<i>a</i>), the walls of which are coated with the asci. The asci
(<i>b</i>) contain only a small number of spores, and these are set
free by the putrefaction of the fruit-body. Conidia are unknown.</p>

the largest number of Truffles, which are hunted by specially
trained dogs and pigs.</p>

<p>In <i>Elaphomyces</i> (Stag-Truffle) the fruit-body has a corky

<h4>Family 3. <b>Pyrenomycetes.</b></h4>

<p>In this family the hymenium is enclosed in small fruit-bodies,
<i>perithecia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig120">120</a> <i>b</i>), which appear to the naked eye
as small dots. In shape they resemble a globe or a flask with a narrow
mouth, through which the spores are ejected (peronocarpic ascocarps).
Different kinds of reproduction&mdash;conidia, pycnidia (chiefly with
microconidia), chlamydospores, and perithecia&mdash;are found in the same
species. The various stages in the life-history of these Fungi are so
dissimilar, that formally they were considered to be different genera.
Ergot furnishes a very good example.</p>

generally aggregated on a stroma. Conidia and chlamydospores occur very
frequently. Only one order.</p>

<p>Order. <b>Hypocreaceæ.</b> In this order the majority are parasites
upon Flowering-plants (<i>Nectria</i>, <i>Polystigma</i>,
<i>Epichloë</i>, <i>Claviceps</i>); but some are parasites upon
Fungi (<i>Hypomyces</i>, <i>Melanospora</i>), or upon insects
(<i>Cordyceps</i>).</p>

<p>The most important member of this order is the <span class="smcap">Ergot</span>
(<i>Claviceps purpurea</i>, Figs. <a href="#fig114">114</a>, <a href="#fig115">115</a>, <a href="#fig116">116</a>). This Fungus is
found in the flowers of many species of Grasses, especially the
Rye, attacking and destroying the ovaries. In the <span class="allsmcap">FIRST</span> or
<span class="allsmcap">CONIDIAL STAGE</span> of the attack, the ovaries are found covered
with a white, irregularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> folded mycelium (Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a> <i>m</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig115">115</a>), formed of numerous hyphæ woven together and penetrating the wall
of the ovary. From these a number of hyphæ (Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a> <i>a</i>) project
into the air and abstrict from their apices the conidia (<i>b</i>)
which serve as reproductive organs. The mycelium also secretes a
sticky, stinking fluid (honey-dew) in which the conidia are embedded
in great numbers. The honey-dew exudes from the bases of the glumes,
and is greedily sought by flies, which thus carry the conidia to
other ovaries. In this manner fresh ears are infected, which might
escape were the conidia only distributed by the wind. This stage
formerly was regarded as an independent Fungus, known as <i>Sphacelia
segetum</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig115">115</a>). On germination, the conidia produce either
a new mycelium (Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a> <i>d</i>, <i>c</i>), or new conidia. The
<span class="allsmcap">SECOND</span> or <span class="allsmcap">SCLEROTIUM STAGE</span> is the one in which the
Fungus passes the winter. The mycelium penetrates deeper and deeper
into the attacked ovaries, their tissues are destroyed and replaced by
the hyphæ, which gradually become more and more felted together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> A
firm, pseudo-parenchymatous mass of hyphæ is thus formed at the base
of the loosely-woven <i>Sphacelia</i>, which is in part transformed
into the hard sclerotium, and the remainder thrown off. A dark, hard,
poisonous body, longer than the natural grain, is thus formed; these
bodies are known as Ergots, and were formerly considered to be a
distinct species,&mdash;<i>Sclerotium clavus</i> (“Secale cornutum,” Ergot,
Fig. <a href="#fig116">116</a> <i>A</i>, <i>c</i>). The <span class="allsmcap">THIRD STAGE</span>, described as
<i>Claviceps purpurea</i>, is developed in the following spring from
the germinating sclerotium, which produces dark-red stromata with short
stalks. In the stroma numerous perithecia with asci and ascospores are
produced. The latter may infect young flowers of the cereals, in which
the disease is then developed as before.</p>

exposed on their upper surface. In the first three sub-families, and
generally also in the fourth, the apothecia are formed inside the
substratum. The apothecia are, in contrast to the Pyrenomycetes, light
and brightly coloured, and their size varies very much, and may be
several centimetres in diameter. Paraphyses are often present between
the asci; they often contain colouring matter, and give to the disc its
characteristic colour. The tissue on which the asci are borne is known
as the <i>hypothecium</i>. The shape and colour of the spores is not so
varied as in the Pyrenomycetes. The accessory forms of reproduction are

<p class="smcap center p2">Appendix to the Ascomycetes:</p>


<h4>Family 7. <b>Ascolichenes (Lichen-forming Ascomycetes).</b></h4>

<p>The Lichens were formerly classed among the Thallophyta as a group
quite distinct from the Algæ and Fungi. Investigations during the last
twenty-five years, however, have conclusively proved that the Lichens
are Fungi which reproduce in the same manner as the Ascomycetes, or,
more rarely, the Basidiomycetes, and have entered into a peculiar
<i>symbiotic relation with Algæ</i>, especially the Cyanophyceæ and
Protococcoideæ, with which they associate, and without which they
would be unable to exist. The Fungus forms the largest portion of the
Lichen, enclosing the Alga with which it may be said to be commensal.
The Fungus especially produces reproductive bodies and absorbs the
inorganic nourishment through the rhizoids, whilst the Alga supplies
it with the organic materials. In consequence of this the Lichens, in
contradistinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> to other Fungi, need light for the development of
their nutritive organs, and are therefore, in any case internally, of
a more or less greenish colour. The form and condition of the thallus
is unusual among the Fungi, and they can grow upon rocks and in other
places where no dead organic matter, such as would be required by other
Fungi, is obtainable.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig131" style="width: 516px">
     <img
    class="p2"
    src="images/fig131.jpg"
     alt="" />
     <p class="p0 sm"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131.</span>&mdash;Transverse section through
the thallus of <i>Sticta fuliginosa</i> (× 500): <i>r-r</i>
rhizoid-strands, which arise from the under side; <i>g-g</i> gonidial
layer; <i>m</i> medullary layer; <i>o</i> upper, <i>u</i> lower cortex.</p>
  </div>

<p>Two cellular forms are therefore to be found in each Lichen:</p>

<p>1. The cells which belong to the Fungus. These are generally septate,
branched <i>hyphæ</i> without any trace of chlorophyll. In the thallus
of the majority of Lichens there may be found a medullary layer (Fig.
<a href="#fig131">131</a> <i>m</i>) of loosely-woven hyphæ, between which there are large air
chambers; and an <i>external layer</i> (cortex) (Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a> <i>o</i>,
<i>u</i>) formed of closely-woven hyphæ without any intercellular
spaces. In some Lichens (Collemaceæ) the hyphæ wind about in the
thallus, being equally distributed throughout, without forming any
decided strata. These Lichens moreover become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> gelatinous when exposed
to moisture (Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>), on account of the swelling of the walls of
the Algæ. The hyphæ contain protoplasm with drops of oil, but never
starch; their walls easily swell when exposed to damp after having
been dried, and in some (<i>e.g. Cetraria islandica</i>) they
become gelatinous when cooked. Certain strata of hyphæ become blue on
treatment with iodine alone, from which it is inferred that the wall is
allied, in its chemical nature, to starch.</p>

<p>2. The enclosed Algæ, termed “gonidia.” Some belonging to the
Cyanophyceæ, Protococcoideæ, (especially <i>Pleurococcus</i>) and
Chroococcaceæ, are spherical and are found isolated, or in irregular
<i>groups</i> of cells (Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a> <i>g</i>); some belonging to
<i>Nostoc</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a> <i>g</i>), Lyngbyaceæ, etc., are placed in
cell-rows. Each Lichen, as a rule, has only one definite Algal-form for
its gonidium.</p>

<p>The gonidia either lie together in a certain stratum between the
cortex and the medullary layer (Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a> <i>g</i>), or are scattered
irregularly throughout the entire thallus (Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>). The thallus is
in the first instance termed “heteromerous,” in the second instance,
“homoiomerous.” The Fungal-hyphæ embrace the gonidia and apply
themselves closely to, or even penetrate them, and hence it has been
difficult to decide whether the one cellular form does or does not
develop from the other (Figs. <a href="#fig134">134</a>, <a href="#fig135">135</a>).</p>

the centre (Figs. <a href="#fig138">138</a>, <a href="#fig139">139</a>, <a href="#fig140">140</a>).</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Foliaceous</span>. This also lies flat upon the substratum,
but is not firmly attached to and has a definite outline. It grows at
the margin, and raises itself a little by free outgrowths and lobes
(Fig. <a href="#fig141">141</a>). The rhizoid-strands spring out from its whitish under
surface (Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a>, <i>r</i>).</p>

<p>The Lichens, like other Ascomycetes, have very variously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> constructed
ascospores (Fig. <a href="#fig137">137</a>), which are enclosed in asci (Fig. <a href="#fig136">136</a>), usually
surrounded by paraphyses attached together. Furthermore they possess
pycnidia (Fig. <a href="#fig141">141</a>) containing numerous microconidia. These were
formerly considered as organs of fructification, and were termed
“spermatia,” and the pycnidia, “spermogonia.” Alfr. Möller proved,
in 1887, that the microconidia are able to germinate and produce a
mycelium with new conidia, just as in other Ascomycetes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetative Reproduction</span> takes place by <i>soredia</i>,
which to the naked eye appear as whitish powder on the surface of
the thallus. They are small round bodies, formed by one or a group
of gonidia, which are surrounded by a mass of felted hyphæ. After
the rupture of the cortex they are set free, and readily carried by
the wind to other places, where under favourable circumstances they
establish a new thallus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span> The Lichens are the most hardy
plants, and are the first to appear on hitherto bare rocks which they
gradually disintegrate, and hence prepare the way for the growth of
other plants. They are to be found from the Polar regions to the
Equator; from the highest snow-free mountain-peaks down to the level of
the sea; on the stems of trees; on rocks, soil, some even on inundated
places; on stones in woodland streams, and on beaches; but they are
never found upon rotten organic remains. Some grow gregariously in
enormous masses, and form wide-stretching carpets, <i>e.g.</i> Reindeer
Moss (<i>Cladonia rangiferina</i>), species of <i>Cetraria</i> and
other fruticose Lichens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> On account of the cell-wall being composed of
Lichenstarch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> (Lichenin), the Iceland-Lichen and Manna-Lichen
(<i>Lecanora esculenta</i>) are used as food; the latter grows on
stones, in the deserts of Asia and North Africa, and is often torn
loose in large masses and carried away by the wind. The Reindeer-Lichen
is not only the principal food of the reindeer, but it is also used in
the manufacture of Danish brandy. <i>Cetraria islandica</i> (Lichen
islandicus) is <span class="allsmcap">OFFICINAL</span>. Colouring materials (lacmus,
orseille, persio) are made from several species, especially from
<i>Roccella tinctoria</i> (from the rocky coasts of the Mediterranean).
<i>Parmelia saxatilis</i> and particularly <i>Lecanora tartarea</i> are
used for colouring purposes in the Northern countries.</p>

<p>About 2,000 species of Lichens have been described. If we disregard the
Basidiolichenes, which will be considered on page <a href="#Page_176">176</a>, the remaining
Lichens (Ascolichenes) may be divided into the two following orders
according to the structure of the fruit-bodies:&mdash;</p>

spherical or flask-shaped, as in the Pyrenomycetes, more rarely linear
(<i>Graphis</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to the nature of the thallus, these Lichens may be
divided into:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Thallus homoiomerous, gelatinous: <i>Lichina</i>.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Thallus heteromerous, crustaceous: <i>Verrucaria</i>,
<i>Pyrenula</i>; <i>Graphis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig139">139</a>), which may be

<h3 class="smaller">Sub-Class 2. <b>Basidiomycetes.</b></h3>

<p>This sub-class embraces the most highly developed Fungi, with large
“fruit-bodies,” which in ordinary language we shortly term Funguses,
Toadstools, or Mushrooms.</p>

<p>They have no sporangia, but reproduce only by means of basidiospores,
conidia, chlamydospores and oidia. The chief characteristic of
this sub-class is the <i>basidium</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig145">145</a>), <i>i.e.</i> the
conidiophore, which has a distinctive form, and bears a definite number
(generally 4) of characteristically shaped conidia (basidiospores, Fig.
<a href="#fig145">145</a> <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig145" style="width: 750px">

     alt="" />
     <p class="p0 sm center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 145.</span>&mdash;Development of spores in
<i>Corticium</i>.</p>
  </div>

<p>The summit of each basidium is produced generally into four conical
points (<i>sterigmata</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig145">145</a> <i>b</i>), from each of which a
basidiospore is abstricted. The basidia may be classified into three
principal groups, each of which accompanies a distinctive conidiophore:
1, the long, filamentous, <i>transversely divided</i> basidia, with
lateral sterigmata and spores, found in the Uredinaceæ (Figs. <a href="#fig146">146</a>
<i>D</i>, <a href="#fig153">153</a>), Auriculariaceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig10">160</a> <i>B</i>), and Pilacraceæ; 2,
the spherical, <i>longitudinally divided</i> basidia of the Tremellaceæ
(Figs. <a href="#fig160">160</a> <i>C d</i>; <a href="#fig160">161</a> iii. iv.); and 3, the ovoid, or
cylindrical, <i>undivided</i> basidia of the Autobasidiomycetes (Figs.
<a href="#fig145">145</a>, <a href="#fig163">163</a>, etc.); the two last have apical sterigmata and spores.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first two groups are the septate basidia
(<i>protobasidia</i>), of the <i>Protobasidiomycetes</i>;
while the unseptate basidia (autobasidia) of the
<i>Autobasidiomycetes</i> are the third group. On the formation
of the basidiospores, the nucleus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> of the basidium divides into
four nuclei, each of which is transferred to a spore.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the basidia, <i>simple conidiophores</i> are also
found. In the Protobasidiomycetes, the simple conidia are very
generally found as accessory methods of reproduction in conjunction
with the basidiospores; but less frequently in the Autobasidiomycetes,
<i>e.g.</i> among the Dacryomycetes, Tomentellaceæ, <i>Heterobasidion
annosum</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The simple conidiophores vary in size, and in the number and
shape of the conidia; they, however, resemble the basidia,
and are doubtless an early stage in the development of the
definitely formed basidia.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, well-defined <i>chlamydospores</i>, formed in various ways,
appear in the Basidiomycetes as supplementary reproductive bodies
(compare p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>). Among the Protobasidiomycetes, chlamydospores are at
present only found among the Uredinaceæ, but in various forms; in the
majority of families of the Autobasidiomycetes <i>oidia</i> frequently
occur (Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>), but genuine chlamydospores seldom.</p>

<p>In the same species several of the known forms of reproduction may be
distinguished.</p>

<p>The <i>mycelium</i> is generally composed of white, branched strands,
consisting of numerous felted hyphæ; in some, sclerotia are found.&mdash;The
great majority are saprophytes; some (particularly all the Uredinaceæ),
are parasites.</p>

<h5>Series I. <b>Protobasidiomycetes.</b></h5>

<p>To this series belong the lowest of the Basidiomycetes. The
<i>basidia</i> appear in two principal forms (1 and 2 on page <a href="#Page_144">144</a>)
and are <i>divided</i> into four cells, either transversely or
longitudinally, each division forming a sterigma which abstricts a
basidiospore. The first three orders, Uredinaceæ, Auriculariaceæ, and
Tremellaceæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> have <i>gymnocarpic</i> fruit-bodies, while those of the
Pilacraceæ, on the contrary, are <i>angiocarpic</i>.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Uredinaceæ (Rusts).</b> All the Rust-Fungi are parasites,
their mycelium living in the interior of the stems and leaves of their
hosts, causing red, brown, or black spots&mdash;hence their name&mdash;and
malformations, sometimes of considerable size.</p>

<p>The Rust-Fungi are gymnocarpic and destitute of a hymenium; for these
reasons they are regarded as the simplest order of the Basidiomycetes.
They are entirely parasitic, and their filamentous, branched mycelium
ramifies in the intercellular spaces of its host, and often protrudes
haustoria into the cells. The mycelium is perennial should it enter
a woody tissue; it may also hibernate in the rhizomes of perennial
herbs and permeate the shoots springing from them, but in the majority
of the Rust-Fungi the mycelium has a very limited growth. The chief
means of reproduction of the Rust-Fungi are the <i>chlamydospores</i>,
which in the more highly developed species occur in three forms,
namely, the teleuto-, æcidio-, and uredo-spores. The spores, in the
host, are formed immediately beneath its epidermis, which is ruptured
on the ripening of the spores, with the production of “rust,” brown,
red, or black spots. Those chlamydospores which produce basidia
are termed <i>teleutospores</i>. The spore on germination produces
a <i>transversely divided basidium</i>, “promycelium,” on which
basidiospores, “sporidia,” generally four in number, are produced on
lateral sterigmata. This basidio-fructification is <i>gymnocarpic</i>;
the basidia neither form a hymenium nor a fruit-body (only
<i>Cronartium</i> and <i>Gymnosporangium</i> have a slight indication
of a basidio-fructification).</p>

<p>Many Rust-Fungi, in addition to basidiospores, have small,
<i>unicellular conidia</i>, “spermatia,” which are borne in
conidiocarps, “<i>spermogonia</i>.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smaller">TELEUTOSPORES</span> (<i>Winter-spores</i>) may be either
unicellular or multicellular; in the majority of cases they are
enclosed in a hard outer cell-wall, the exospore, which in some cases
is very strongly developed; they have also a long or short stalk, the
remains of the spore-bearing hypha. Each cell of the teleutospore has
<i>one germ-pore</i> (a thin portion of the wall, for the protrusion of
the germ-tube; in <i>Phragmidium</i> and <i>Gymnosporangium</i> there
are, however, several germ-pores). The colour of the teleutospores is
generally much darker than that of the uredospores, and it is by these
that the majority of the Rust-Fungi <i>hibernate</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In <i>Gymnosporangium</i>, two kinds of teleutospores are found
(distinguished by their size and thickness of exospore). In many
species of <i>Puccinia</i>, the form of the teleutospores varies
very much, so that in the same layer spores have been observed
with the characteristic form of other, allied genera.&mdash;The
teleutospores of <i>Endophyllum</i> resemble æcidiospores, since
they are united in chains, whose cells are easily separated, and
are produced in the interior of a “peridium.” The multicellular
teleutospores of <i>Coleosporium</i> function as basidia,
and from each cell immediately produce basidiospores.&mdash;The
teleutospores of <i>Coleosporium</i> and <i>Chrysomyxa</i>,
differ from other teleutospores in the absence of exospore and
germ-pore.</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">ÆCIDOSPORES</span> (<i>Spring-spores</i>) are produced in chains
which are generally enclosed in an <i>envelope</i> of hyphæ, the
<i>peridium</i>; the <i>peridium</i> enclosing the spores being termed
the <i>æcidium</i>. The æcidiospores are unicellular, and generally of
an orange colour; they are often separated by intermediate cells which
wither and so assist in the distribution of the spores. The exospore is
made up of minute, radially arranged rods. <i>Generally germination</i>
proceeds <i>immediately</i>, the æcidiospore producing a germ-tube,
which developes into a mycelium bearing either uredo- or teleutospores.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The æcidia of many Rust-Fungi were formerly considered
as distinct genera. The æcidia of <i>Phragmidium</i>,
<i>Triphragmium</i>, and <i>Melampsora</i>, in which the
<i>peridium is wanting</i>, were in part considered as
<i>Cæoma</i>. The æcidia with fimbriate edge, or those
of <i>Gymnosporangium</i> with longitudinal lattice-like
splits, were considered as “<i>Rœstelia</i>” (Lattice-Rust);
large, sac-shaped æcidia on the Coniferæ were known as
<i>Peridermium</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smaller">UREDOSPORES</span> (<i>Summer-spores</i>) are unicellular and arise
singly, seldom in chains (<i>Coleosporium</i>). Their colourless, warty
exospore bears, <i>in the equatorial plane</i>, 2–8 <i>germ-pores</i>.
In the majority, <i>germination</i> proceeds <i>immediately</i>, and
a mycelium is produced which at first gives rise to uredospores and
afterwards to teleutospores.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The uredospore-formations of <i>Melampsorella</i> and
<i>Cronartium</i> are enclosed in an <i>envelope</i>, and hence
resemble æcidia.&mdash;Between the uredospores sterile, unicellular
hyphæ (paraphyses) may be found.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>spermogonia</i> are spherical or pear-shaped
<i>conidiocarps</i>, generally embedded in the substratum, and
are produced before the æcidia, before or simultaneously with the
uredospores, or before the teleutospores. The conidia, as far as
observations go, do not generally germinate under ordinary conditions.</p>

<p>Among the Rust-Fungi some species are found which only form
basidiospores and teleutospores (<i>Puccinia malvacearum</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
<i>Chrysomyxa abietis</i>). Other species have in addition uredospores;
others spermogonia and uredospores; others spermogonia and æcidia;
others spermogonia, uredospores and æcidia. Those species in which all
the methods of reproduction are not developed must not be considered as
incomplete forms.</p>

<p>As a rule the mycelium, which is produced from the basidiospores,
developes æcidia; in the species, however, without æcidia, it
developes the uredo-form, and when the uredospores are also absent,
the teleutospore-form. It has been established in some species of
<i>Puccinia</i> and <i>Uromyces</i> that the formation of æcidia can be
suppressed, and it is not a necessary part of the cycle of development
of the species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The majority of Rust-Fungi hibernate in the teleutospore-form.
Many species are able to hibernate in the uredospore-form
(<i>Coleosporium senecionis</i>). Others pass the winter in
the æcidio-form, and develope æcidia on new hosts (<i>Uromyces
pisi</i>, on <i>Euphorbia cyparissias</i>; <i>Phragmidium
subcorticium</i>, on <i>Rosa</i>; <i>Æcidium elatinum</i>, on
<i>Abies alba</i>). In <i>Chrysomyxa abietis</i>, the mycelium,
developed from the basidiospores, survives the winter.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the Rust-Fungi, with several forms of reproduction, there
are about sixty whose development can only be completed by an
<i>alternation of hosts</i>, that is, on one host only uredo-and
teleutospores are produced, while the further development of the
germinating basidiospores, and the formation of the æcidia and
spermogonia from its mycelium, can only take place on a second quite
distinct and definite host (<i>heterœcious</i> or <i>metoxenous</i>
Fungi). Those Fungi which have all their forms of reproduction on the
same host are termed <i>autœcious</i> or <i>autoxenous</i>. It is
not, however, always necessary that the heterœcious Rust-Fungi should
regularly change their hosts; for example, <i>Puccinia graminis</i> can
hibernate in the uredo-form on the wild Grasses, and in the spring can
distribute itself again in the same form.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a consequence of the alternation of hosts the various
forms of development were considered as independent genera
(<i>Uredo</i>, <i>Æcidium</i>, <i>Rœstelia</i>, <i>Cæoma</i>,
<i>Peridermium</i>), until De Bary and Oersted established,
about the same time (1865), the mutual connection of some forms,
and paved the way for the right conception of these Fungi.</p>

  </div>

<p>As an example of one of the most highly developed species, <i>Puccinia
graminis</i>, the “Rust of Wheat,” holds a prominent position. Its
uredospores and teleutospores are produced (Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>) on Grasses
(on cereals, especially Wheat, Rye, Oats, and many wild Grasses),
while the æcidia and spermogonia are confined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> the Berberidaceæ.
The teleutospores, developed on the Grasses, hibernate on the dried
portions of their host, and in the succeeding year each of the two
cells of the teleutospore may develop a <i>basidium</i> with four
basidiospores (Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a> <i>D</i>, <i>c</i>). The basidiospores
are distributed by the wind, germinate quickly, and only proceed
to further development on <i>Berberis</i> or <i>Mahonia</i>. The
germ-tube <i>bores through the epidermis</i> of the Barberry-leaf,
and forms a mycelium in its interior, its presence being indicated by
reddish-yellow spots on the leaf. After 6–10 days the flask-shaped
<i>spermogonia</i> appear (Fig. <a href="#fig147">147</a> <i>B</i>; <i>C</i>, <i>a</i>;
conidia in Fig. <a href="#fig147">147</a> <i>D</i>) and a few days later the cup-shaped
<i>æcidia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig147">147</a> <i>A</i>; <i>C</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>). The former are generally on the <i>upper</i>, and the latter
on the <i>under side</i> of the leaf. The orange-coloured æcidiospores
scatter like dust, and germinate only on Grasses; the germination takes
place in about two days when placed on any green part of a Grass.
The germ-tube enters the Grass-leaf through a stoma; a mycelium is
developed in the leaf, giving rise to a small, oval, rust-coloured spot
(Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a> <i>A</i>); in about 6–9 days the epidermis is ruptured over
the red spot, and numerous reddish-yellow <i>uredospores</i>, formed
on the mycelium, are set free. The uredospores (Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a> <i>B</i>) are
scattered by the wind, and can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> germinate should they fall on the green
portions of other Grasses: they then emit 2–4 germ-tubes through the
equatorially-placed germ-pores. The germ-tubes enter a leaf through
a stoma, a new mycelium is then developed, and in about eight days a
fresh production of uredospores takes place, which germinate as before.
The uredospore-mycelium very soon produces, in addition, the brown
<i>teleutospores</i>, which give a brown colour to the rust-coloured
spots, the familiar uredospores on the cereals being quite suppressed
towards the close of the summer (Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a> <i>C, D</i>). The “Rust of
Wheat” hibernates on some wild Grasses in the uredospore-form.</p>

<h4>Family 1. <b>Dacryomycetes.</b></h4>

<p>The <i>long, club-shaped basidia</i> bear <i>two tapering
sterigmata</i>, which develope remarkably large basidiospores (Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>
II, XI) and form <i>gymnocarpic</i> fruit-bodies with hymenium. 1 order:</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Dacryomycetaceæ.</b> This order comprises 4 genera of
which the first two develope the hymenium on the whole surface of the
fruit-body, but the two last only on its apex.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dacryomyces</i>: the folded, gelatinous, <i>Tremella</i>-like
fruit-bodies break out in winter on dried wood (hedges) in the
form of red or yellow drops. <i>D. deliquescens</i> is very
common (Fig. <a href="#fig121">121</a>). The following genera have cartilaginous
fruit-bodies.&mdash;<i>Calocera</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>), with club-like,
simple, or branched, <i>Clavaria</i>-like, fruit-bodies;
the orange coloured fruit-bodies of <i>C. viscosa</i> grow
aggregated together on the wood of Conifers.&mdash;<i>Guepinia</i>
resembles a <i>Peziza</i>, and has the hymenium only on
the hollow upper surface.&mdash;<i>Dacryomitra</i> resembles a
<i>Mitrula</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>).</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Hymenomycetes.</b></h4>

<p>This family is very rich in species (more than 8000 have been
described), and to it belong all the “Mushrooms” and “Toadstools.” The
<i>fruit-bodies</i> present very various forms; they are generally
fleshy, very perishable, seldom leathery or corky, in the last case
often perennial. The <i>basidia</i> are more or less <i>cylindrical</i>
and bear <i>generally</i> 4 (seldom 2, 6 or 8) <i>sterigmata and
basidiospores</i>. The hymenium in the fully-formed fruit-bodies lies
free on the surface: in orders 1 and 2 and a portion of order 6 it is
from the commencement exposed, fruit-bodies <i>gymnocarpic</i>; orders
3–6 have <i>hemiangiocarpic</i> fruit-bodies (p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>). In the first
order the basidia (or the hymenium) are developed immediately from
the mycelium (Fig. <a href="#fig163">163</a>); the fruit-bodies of orders 2 and 3 present a
higher grade of development, and have between the mycelium and hymenium
a special hyphal-tissue, a <i>stroma</i>, which is crustaceous,
club-like, or coralloid, etc., and in general bears the hymenium
on the largest part of the free, smooth surface. In the forms most
highly developed (orders 4–6) a new tissue&mdash;the <i>hymenophore</i>&mdash;is
introduced between the stroma and hymenium, which appears on the under
side of the fruit-body in the form of warts, projections, tubes,
folds or lamellæ (Figs. <a href="#fig166">166</a>, <a href="#fig167">167</a>, <a href="#fig174">174</a> <i>bc</i>). <i>Paraphyses</i>
are frequently found in the hymenium, among the basidia. In the
Hymenomycetes few examples of <i>conidia</i> can be recognised at
first. More frequently <i>chlamydospores</i> are found, particularly
<i>oidia</i>. The <i>mycelium</i> is richly branched, generally
colourless, often perennial; it lives in humus or decaying wood, and
is seldom parasitic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> The hyphæ generally have clamp-connections and
unite, sometimes, to form a rhizomorpha (Fig. <a href="#fig177">177</a>) or sclerotia with
coloured, pseudo-parenchymatous covering.</p>

well defined <i>upper portion</i> of it (<i>Typhula</i>). Paraphyses
absent. The vertical, white, yellow, or red fruit-bodies are roundish

on the under side of the fruit-body, and consists of wide or narrow
<i>tubes</i> or <i>pores</i>, whose inner surface is clothed with the
hymenium (Fig. <a href="#fig167">167</a>). In some fruit-bodies large cavities are to be

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Genera.</span> <i>Polyporus</i> (Pore-Fungus). The tubes are
narrow, accurately fitted together, and forming a thick layer
on the under side of the fruit-body, appearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> as a number of
fine holes. The fruit-body most frequently resembles a bracket,
or is hoof-shaped, with one side growing from a tree-trunk; it
is very often perennial, and a new layer of tubes arises in
each succeeding period of vegetation. Strata, corresponding to
the periodically interrupted growth, are thus formed in storeys
one above the other, and are visible on the upper surface of
the fruit-body, as well as in the interior, as a series of
concentric belts, sometimes as many as half a score or more
in number. <i>P. fomentarius</i> (Touchwood) attacks trees,
especially the Beech. The spores germinate on wounds from broken
branches, and the hyphæ, following the course of the medullary
rays, find their way into the interior of the tree, from whence
the mycelium spreads upwards, downwards, and peripherally, so
that the wood becomes rotten (“white-rot”) and thick felts of
mycelium are formed in radial and tangential directions. A dark
line, caused by the youngest parts of the hyphæ containing a
brown juice, marks the boundary between the rotten and the
unattacked parts of the stem (Fig. <a href="#fig168">168</a>); at places where the
mycelium extends to the bark, the cambium becomes destroyed and
further growth is arrested, so that longitudinal furrows arise
on the stem. It is at these places, too, that the hoof-shaped,
ash-coloured fruit-bodies are developed, which may attain
a circumference of upwards of 7 feet. The interior of the
fruit-body consists of a dried-up, loosely felted, red-brown
mass of hyphæ, which has been used for tinder and as a styptic
(“Fungus chirurgorum”). <i>P. igniarius</i> has a harder,
dark-brown, more rounded fruit-body; it grows in a similar
manner, but especially attacks Oaks, Poplars, and Plum-trees,
the wood of which becomes rotten, and is called touchwood. <i>P.
pini</i> (<i>Trametes pini</i>), (Fig. <a href="#fig170">170</a>), a parasite on the
stems of <i>Pinus</i>, causes a kind of “red-rot” in the stem.
<i>P. sulphureus</i> has a soft, cheesy, yellow fruit-body; it
produces “rot” in Oaks and Apple-trees. <i>P. officinalis</i>,
Larch-fungus (“Fungus Laricis” in Pharmocopœia), grows on
Larch-trees in the south-east of Europe. <i>P. versicolor</i>
has thin, semicircular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> fruit-bodies, with zones of various
colours on the upper side; it is one of the most frequent
species on tree-stems. <i>P. frondosus</i> grows on soil in
woods, and consists of numerous aggregated fruit-bodies, which
become very large and fleshy. This species is edible. <i>P.
perennis</i> also grows on the soil in woods; it is very
leathery, with central stalk, and has concentric zones on the
upper surface of the fruit-body. <i>P. vaporarius</i> destroys
the wood of living Pines (<i>Pinus silvestris</i>) and Firs
(<i>Picea excelsa</i>), causing it to become red-brown; in
timber this Fungus causes “red-strip” followed by a “dry-rot.”
<i>P. squamosus</i> destroys many Walnut-trees, and is also
very destructive to Limes and Elms. <i>P. fulvus</i> causes a
“white-rot” in <i>Abies alba</i>.</p>

the Pine, Fir, Birch, Beech, etc.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> and is the chief cause of
a root-disease (red-rot) in Pines and Firs; the fruit-bodies
develope a large number of basidiospores; they may be very large
and are found just beneath the surface of the soil (on living or
dead roots), and exposed to the air (on felled stems and roots,
in Scandinavia).</p>

<p><i>Ptychogaster</i> has cushion-like fruit-bodies, which
consist chiefly of chlamydospore-chains, formed of ellipsoidal
spores, which alternate with short hyphæ having transverse
septa and clamp-connections. The hymenial portion is limited
to a small group of tubes. <i>Pt. albus</i> (<i>Oligorus
ustilaginoides</i>) grows on stumps of Conifers and forms
irregular cushions, at first white and later on brown, which
consist almost entirely of chlamydospores.</p>

<p><i>Boletus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig171">171</a>) has a fleshy fruit-body resembling
a common Mushroom, with central stalk. The layer of tubes is
easily detached from the pileus, and the tubes are easily
separable from one another. They grow on the ground in woods.
Edible species are: <i>B. edulis</i>, with thick, reticulate
stalk; <i>B. scaber</i>, with thin stalk and rough pileus;
<i>B. luteus</i>, with a ring on the stalk. <i>B. luridus</i>
is poisonous, its tubes have red openings, and the flesh turns
quickly blue when broken and exposed to the air.</p>

<p><i>Fistulina hepatica</i> (Beef-steak Fungus), has a red,
fleshy, edible fruit-body, with red juice. The tubes are
individually distinct; conidia are also developed. Grows on old
Oaks.</p>

<p><i>Merulius lacrymans</i> (“Dry-rot”) has a resupinate
fruit-body with white, cotton-like border, and the remaining
portions covered by reticulate, ramified veins of a rust-brown
colour. In favourable vegetative conditions it is fleshy and
exudes large drops of water&mdash;hence its specific name and also
the name “Tear Fungus.” The mycelium is at first colourless,
and then yellow-brown; when dry it is tough and leathery. It
destroys the timber in damp houses, extends far and wide over
boards and beams and even over the masonry, giving rise to a
disagreeable smell in the rooms in which it lodges. In woods
the Fungus lives on Pine-stems. It is brought from the forest
on the logs of timber, and is distributed from log to log by
the mycelium and the basidiospores. The living mycelium can be
recognised by the clamp-connections shooting out branches. The
basidiospores are often ejected a distance of a metre; they are
elliptical (10–11µ long and 5–6µ broad), and germinate easily
on damp wood, or in fruit-juice which has been neutralized with
urine or alkaline carbonates.</p>

<p><i>Dædalea</i> (Labyrinth Fungus), has bracket-like, corky
fruit-bodies with irregularly-folded plates or discs on the

to the stalk; those formed later reach only a longer or shorter portion
of this distance, according to their age. In structure the lamellæ
(Fig. <a href="#fig174">174</a>) consist of a central mass of hyphæ, the <i>trama</i>,
continuous with the hyphæ of the pileus; these terminate in a layer of
shorter cells, the <i>subhymenial layer</i>, immediately beneath the
hymenium which is composed of basidia and paraphyses. In a few species,

(<i>Psalliota campestris</i>).</p>
  </div>

<p>The mycelium mostly grows in soils rich in humus or dung, on decaying
trees and similar objects. Many species, <i>e.g. Tricholoma
personatum</i> and <i>Marasmius oreades</i>, form the so-called “fairy
rings.” The fruit-bodies in these species are confined to a larger or
smaller surface on which they are very regularly arranged in a ring.
The reason for this is found in the radial growth of the mycelium,
so that the oldest portion, or the starting point, is found at the
centre of the ring, and the younger ones, on which the fruit-bodies are
formed, at the circumference. The older hyphæ gradually die, and at
the same time, the radial growth continuing, the ring of fruit-bodies
becomes larger and larger. The “fairy-rings” are marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> not only by
the fruit-bodies, but also by the more vigorous growth and darker
colour of the grass upon these spots.</p>

<p>Some species are <i>parasites</i>. An example is presented by
<i>Armillaria mellea</i>, a remarkable and very destructive Fungus in
woods and forests (Figs. <a href="#fig176">176</a>, <a href="#fig177">177</a>). <span class="smaller">In addition to the filamentous,
white mycelium, it has also black, or black-brown, horny, root-like
mycelium-strands (rhizomorpha) which were formerly considered
to belong to a special genus of Fungi described under the name
“<i>Rhizomorpha</i>.” The mycelium lives parasitically on the Conifers
and other trees, forcing its hyphæ into the bark and between the bark
and wood, and thence penetrating into the wood so that the tree is very
severely attacked. It may also live saprophytically, and clusters of
fruit-bodies are often found on old stumps and stems, on old timber,
and in the rich soil of woods. The rhizomorpha, living underground, can
extend for considerable distances and infect the roots of neighbouring
trees, and spreads in this way the diseases known as “Harzsticken” and
“Bark-Canker,” which are very destructive to young trees.</span></p>

may be obtained by placing the pileus with the lamellæ turned downwards
on a piece of white or coloured paper, so that the spores, as they fall
off, are collected on the paper, and the arrangement of the lamellæ can
then be clearly seen.</p>

<p>2. <b>Marasmiei.</b> Fruit-body tough, almost leathery,
and persistent; spores white. <i>Marasmius oreades</i>
forms large, regular fairy-rings on pastures and commons;
it is used as seasoning in food.&mdash;<i>Panus stipticus</i>
with eccentrically-placed stalk, in clusters on
tree-stumps.&mdash;<i>Schizophyllum</i> has the edge of the
lamellæ divided longitudinally, and the split portions
revolute.&mdash;<i>Lentinus</i> affords a transition to
<i>Dædalea</i> among the Polyporaceæ.</p>

<p>3. <b>Russulei.</b> Fruit-body fleshy and fragile, in which two
different systems of hyphæ may be distinguished; spores thorny,
white, or pale-yellow. Many are poisonous.&mdash;<i>Russula</i> has
generally fragile and thick lamellæ reaching from stalk to

flavour. <i>L. torminosus</i> is poisonous.</p>

<p>4. <b>Hygrophorei.</b> Lamellæ thick and waxy, widely separated;
spores white. Many species of <i>Hygrophorus</i> have
brightly-coloured pileus and grow among the grass on moors and
commons.&mdash;<i>Nyctalis</i> is parasitic on larger Toadstools.
It is remarkable for its abundant formation of chlamydospores,
whilst the basidiospores are little developed.</p>

<p>5. <b>Coprinei.</b> Fruit-bodies very soft, quickly perishable;
lamellæ membranous and deliquescent. The basidia are separated
from each other by paraphyses. <i>Coprinus</i> has coal-black
spores, grows on manure, and sometimes developes sclerotia.</p>

<p>6. <b>Paxillei.</b> Fruit-body fleshy; lamellæ easily detached
from the pileus and reticulately-joined near the stalk. They
form a connecting link between the Agaricaceæ and <i>Boletus</i>.</p>

<p>7. <b>Cantharellei.</b> Lamellæ reduced to dichotomously-divided
folds, decurrent on the stalk. <i>Cantharellus cibarius</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig175">175</a>) is yolk-yellow, and grows on the ground in woods
(edible). It is allied to <i>Craterellus</i>.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 3. <b>Phalloideæ.</b></h4>

<p>The fruit-bodies before they are ripe are spherical or ovoid,
and enclosed by a <i>fleshy covering</i>, the peridium, which is
<i>perforated at maturity</i> and remains as a sheath (Fig. <a href="#fig179">179</a>); the
fruit-bodies are <i>hemiangiocarpic</i>.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Phallaceæ</b> (<b>Stink-horns</b>). The peridium has a
complicated structure and is composed of three layers, the intermediate
one being thick and gelatinous. The gleba (the tissue which bears the
hymenium) is situated upon a peculiar receptacle which expands into
a porous stalk and by its sudden distension, rupturing the peridium,
elevates the gleba and hymenium above the peridium, which remains
as a sheath. <i>The gleba becomes gelatinous and dissolves away as
drops.</i> To this order belong many peculiar and often brightly
coloured forms, which are natives of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Phallus impudicus</i> (Stink-horn) (Fig. <a href="#fig179">179</a>), has a
fruit-body which at first is white, heavy, and soft, and
resembles a hen’s egg in shape and size. The peridium is divided
into three layers (Fig. <a href="#fig179">179</a> <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>f</i>)
of which the external and internal are membranous, and the
middle one very thick and gelatinous; each of these has again
a laminated structure. The peridium when ruptured remains as a
sheath (<i>k</i>) at the base of the stalk. The receptacle at
first is strongly compressed (<i>h</i>) but afterwards expands
into a long stalk (<i>l</i>) which bears the conical gleba
(<i>m</i>). Prior to the rupture of the peridium the gleba
consists of a greenish mass (<i>i</i>) which, when exposed,
emits a carrion-like stench serving to attract flies, by
whose agency the spores are distributed. It is found commonly
in hedgerows and in woods, growing on the ground. The much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
smaller and less common <i>P. caninus</i> is found on rotten
tree-stumps.&mdash;In <i>Clathrus cancellatus</i> the receptacle
expands into a bright red, reticulate structure. A native of the
South of Europe. <i>Colus</i>, <i>Aseroë</i>, <i>Mitromyces</i>.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Sphærobolaceæ.</b> An intermediate layer of the
<i>peridium</i> swells when ripe, becomes convex, and <i>ejects
the remaining</i> spherical <i>portion of the fruit-body</i>
which contains the spores. <i>Sphærobolus carpobolus</i> has
small, spherical fruit-bodies which open in the form of a star.</p>

(Stink-horn), somewhat diminished. Fruit-bodies in all stages of
development (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>k-m</i>) are seen
arising from a root-like mycelium (<i>a</i>); <i>d</i> longitudinal
sections through a fruit-body before the covering has ruptured.</p>
  </div>


<h4>Family 4. <b>Gasteromycetes.</b></h4>

<p>The fruit-body is <i>angiocarpic</i>, fleshy at first, and later
generally more or less <i>hard</i> and <i>continues closed after
the</i> spores <i>are ripe</i>. The tissue lying immediately inside the
<i>peridium</i> is termed the <i>gleba</i>; it is porous, containing
a larger or smaller number of chambers lined with the hymenium, which
is either a continuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> layer of basidia or else it fills up the
entire cavity. The basidia as a rule bear four spores, sometimes eight
(<i>Geaster</i>), or two (<i>Hymenogaster</i>). The tissue of the walls
(<i>trama</i>) consists often (<i>Lycoperdaceæ</i>) of two kinds of
hyphæ, some thin and rich in protoplasm, divided by transverse septa
and bearing the basidia; others thicker and thick-walled which do not
dissolve like the former on the ripening of the spores, but continue to
grow and form a woolly, elastic mass, the <i>capillitium</i>, which may
be regarded as highly developed paraphyses. The peridium may be either
single or double, and presents many variations in its structure and
dehiscence. The mycelium is generally a number of string-like strands,
living in soils rich in humus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Tylostomaceæ.</b> Capillitium present. After the
rupture of the peridium the remaining part of the fruit-body is
elevated on a long <i>stalk</i>. <i>Tylostoma mammosum</i>, on
heaths.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Lycoperdaceæ.</b> The fruit-body has a double peridium;
the external one at length breaks into fragments (<i>Lycoperdon</i>,
<i>Bovista</i>), or it has a compound structure of several layers
(<i>Geaster</i>) and detaches itself as a continuous envelope from
the inner layer, which is membranous and opens at its apex. The
interior of the fruit-body consists either solely of the fertile gleba
(<i>Bovista</i>, <i>Geaster</i>), or, in addition, of a sterile tissue
at the base (<i>Lycoperdon</i>). A capillitium is also present.</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Lycoperdon</i> (Puff-ball) has a sterile part at the base of
the fruit-body which often forms a thick stalk. The surface of
the peridium is generally covered with warts or projections.
When young this Fungus is edible, but when ripe it is dry,
and used for stopping the flow of blood. <i>L. giganteum</i>,
which is often found growing in meadows, attains a considerable
size, its diameter reaching as much as eighteen inches. <i>L.
gemmatum</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig180">180</a>) is covered with pyramidal warts; in
woods.&mdash;<i>Bovista</i> has no sterile basal part; the external
peridium is smooth, and falls away in irregular patches. <i>B.
plumbea</i>, on links near the sea.&mdash;<i>Geaster</i> (Earth-star)
has an external peridium composed of several layers, which when
the fruit-body opens, split into several stellate segments.
These segments are very hygroscopic, and in dry weather bend
backwards and so raise the inner peridium into the air. The
inner peridium contains the spores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> and capillitia. <i>G.
coliformis</i> has several apertures in the inner peridium. The
other species have only one regular aperture at the apex. <i>G.
striatus</i> has a pedicellate inner peridium, with conical,
striped peristome. <i>G. fornicatus</i> has an external peridium
split into four segments. This last and several other species
produce “mycorhiza” on the roots of Conifers.</p>

it becomes cupular or vase-like, and contains several lenticular
“peridiola” lying like eggs in a nest. The peridiola are the chambers
which contain the hymenium, covered by a thin layer of the gleba, all

subterranean, resembling very closely the Truffles, from which they
can only be distinguished with certainty by microscopic means. The
peridium is simple, capillitium wanting, and the gleba encloses a
system of labyrinthine passages covered with a continuous hymenium. The
fruit-bodies persist for some time, and form a fleshy mass, the spores
being only set free by the decay of the fruit-body, or when it is eaten
by animals. The majority are South European. <i>Hymenogaster</i>,

<p class="center"><b>Basidiolichenes (Lichen-forming Basidiomycetes).</b></p>

<p>Several Fungi belonging to the Basidiomycetes have a symbiotic
relationship with Algæ exactly similar to that enjoyed by certain
Ascomycetes, and these are therefore included under the term Lichens
(p. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>). They are chiefly tropical.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Fungi imperfecti (Incompletely known Fungi).</b></p>

<p>1. The <b>Saccharomyces-forms</b> are Fungi which are only known in
their yeast-conidial form. They are <i>conidia of higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> Fungi</i>
which can multiply to an unlimited extent by budding in nutritive
solutions, and in this way maintain their <i>definite</i> size and
shape. The budding takes place <i>only at the ends</i> of the conidia.
The wall of the conidium forms at one or at both ends a small wart-like
outgrowth, which gradually becomes larger, and is finally separated
from its mother-cell as an independent cell, surrounded by a closed
cell-wall (Fig. <a href="#fig182">182</a> <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig182" style="width: 550px">

     <p class="p0 sm"><span class="smcap">Fig. 182.</span>&mdash;Beer-yeast (<i>Saccharomyces
cerevisiæ</i>): <i>a-b</i> (× 400); <i>c-f</i> (× 750); <i>c</i> a
cell in the process of forming spores; <i>d</i> a cell with four
ripe spores; <i>e</i> the spores liberated by the dissolution of the
cell-wall; <i>f</i> three germinating spores; <i>g</i> mycelium-like
cell-chains. (× 1000: after Em. Chr. Hansen.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Under very favourable conditions multiplication occurs so rapidly that
the daughter-cells themselves commence to form buds, before they have
separated from their mother-cell, with the result that pearl-like
chains of cells are produced. When the yeast-cells have only limited
nutriment, with an abundant supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> of air, at a suitable temperature,
an endogenous formation of <i>spores</i> takes place. The protoplasm
of the cells divides into 1–4 (rarely a greater number) masses (Fig.
<a href="#fig182">182</a> <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>) which surround themselves with a
thick cell-wall, and in this state can withstand adverse conditions and
periods of dryness lasting for several months.</p>

<p>The <i>sporangia are not asci</i> since they have no definite form,
and a definite number, form and size of spores is not found. The
spores in the different species and kinds occupy varying periods for
their development, although exposed to the same temperature, a fact of
importance in determining one from another. On germination the wall
of the mother-cell is destroyed, and each spore gives rise to a new
cell, multiplication taking place by budding (Fig. <a href="#fig182">182</a> <i>f</i>). The
majority of Yeast-Fungi are able to produce alcoholic fermentation in
saccharine fluids.</p>

<p>The most important of these Fungi is the Beer-yeast (<i>Saccharomyces
cerevisiæ</i>) with ovate, ellipsoidal or spherical cells (Fig.
<a href="#fig182">182</a>). It is a plant which has been cultivated from time immemorial,
on account of its property of producing alcoholic fermentation in
sugar-containing extracts (wort), derived from germinating barley
(malt). Carbonic acid is also set free during this process. The
“surface-yeast” (Fig. <a href="#fig182">182</a> <i>a</i>), which produces ordinary beer
when the brewing takes place at higher temperatures, has cell-chains;
“sedimentary yeast” (Fig. <a href="#fig182">182</a> <i>b</i>), used in the brewing of
Bavarian beer, has spherical cells, solitary, or united in pairs. Both
these and the following Yeast-Fungi include, according to Hansen,
several species and kinds.</p>

  </div>

<p>The “Ferment of Wine” (<i>Saccharomyces ellipsoideus</i>) produces wine
in the juice of grapes. Uncultivated yeast-cells are always present
on grapes; an addition of this species to the “must” is not necessary
to secure fermentation. A large number of other “uncultivated”
yeast-cells appear in breweries mixed with the cultivated ones, and
cause different tastes to the beer (<i>S. pastorianus</i>, etc.). <i>S.
ludwigii</i>, found, for instance, on the slimy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> discharge from Oaks,
produces abundant cell-chains on cultivation. <i>S. apiculatus</i>
is very frequently met with on all kinds of sweet fruits, it has
orange-like cells. <i>S. mycoderma</i> has cylindrical cells, often
united together in chains (Fig. <a href="#fig183">183</a>): it forms a whitish-gray mass
(“fleur de vin”) on wine, beer, fruit-juice, etc., standing in bottles
uncorked or not entirely filled. It is thought that this Fungus causes
decomposition and oxydises the fluid in which it is found, but it
cannot produce alcoholic fermentation in saccharine liquids, and it
does not form endospores; hence it is uncertain whether it is true

<p>The “Dry-yeast” used in baking white bread is “surface-yeast.” In
<i>leaven</i>, a kneaded mixture of meal, barm and water, which is
used for the manufacture of black bread, <i>Saccharomyces minor</i> is
present, and a species allied to this produces alcoholic fermentation
in dough with the evolution of carbonic acid, which causes the dough to
“rise.”</p>

<p>2. <b>Oidium-forms.</b> Of many Fungi only the Oidium-forms are known,
which multiply in endless series without employing any higher form
of reproduction. <i>Oidium lactis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig184">184</a>) is an imperfectly
developed form which frequently appears on sour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> milk and cheese. It
can produce a feeble alcoholic fermentation in saccharine liquids.
Thrush or aphthæ (<i>O. albicans</i>) appears as white spots in the
mouths of children. Several similar <i>Oidium-forms</i> are parasites
on the skin and hair of human beings, and produce skin diseases, such
as scurvy (<i>O. schoenleinii</i>) and ringworm (<i>O. tonsurans</i>).</p>

<p>3. <b>Mycorhiza.</b> These Fungi, which have been found on the roots
of many trees and heath-plants, particularly Cupuliferæ and Ericaceæ,
consist of septate hyphæ, and belong partly to the Hymenomycetes,
partly to the Gasteromycetes. It has been shown that the Mycorhiza
enters into a symbiotic relationship with the roots of higher plants.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">DIVISION II.<br />
<span class="subhed">MUSCINEÆ (MOSSES).</span></h2></div>

<p>In this Division a well-marked alternation of generations is
to be found. The development of the first or sexual generation
(<i>gametophyte</i>),<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which bears the sexual organs, antheridia
and archegonia, commences with the germination of the spore, and
consists, in the Liverworts, of a thallus, but in the true Mosses of a
filamentous protonema, from which the Moss-plant arises as a lateral
bud. The second or asexual generation (<i>sporophyte</i>), developed
from the fertilised oosphere, consists of a sporangium and stalk.</p>

<p><b>The sexual generation, the gametophyte.</b> The protonema in
the Liverworts is very insignificant, and not always very sharply
demarcated from the more highly developed parts of the nutritive
system. In the true Mosses the protonema is well-developed, and
consists of a branched, alga-like filament of cells, the dividing
cell-walls being always placed obliquely. In the parts exposed to the
light it is green, but colourless or brownish in those parts which are
underground (Fig. <a href="#fig186">186</a>). The protonema is considered to be a lower form
of the stem, and grows in the same manner by means of an apical cell;
at its apex it may directly develope into a leaf-bearing stem, or these
arise from it as lateral branches (Fig. <a href="#fig186">186</a> <i>k</i>).</p>

<p>The more highly differentiated part of the vegetative system, the
“Moss-plant,” which is thus developed from the protonema, is in the
“thalloid” Liverworts generally a dichotomously-branched thallus
without any trace of leaf-structures (Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>); in <i>Marchantia</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a>) and others, scale-like leaves (<i>amphigastria</i>) are
found on the under surface. The higher Liverworts and the Leafy-Mosses
are differentiated into a filamentous, ramified stem with distinct
leaves arranged in a definite manner, resembling the stem and leaves of
the higher plants (Figs. <a href="#fig186">186</a>, <a href="#fig195">195</a>, <a href="#fig200">200</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p><i>True roots are wanting</i>, but are biologically replaced by
<i>rhizoids</i>. These are developed on the stems or thallus: in the
Liverworts they are unicellular, but in the Leafy-Mosses generally
multicellular and branched. In the latter group they are considered
identical with the protonema, and may become true protonema, and new
plants may be developed from them (Fig. <a href="#fig186">186</a> <i>b</i>).</p>

  </div>

<p>The internal structure of the sexual generation is very simple. The
leaves in nearly all cases are formed of a single-layered plate of
cells; in the Leafy-Mosses, however, a midrib is very often formed, and
sometimes, also, marginal veins; and along these lines the leaves are
several layers of cells in thickness. The stem is constructed of cells
longitudinally elongated, the external ones of which are narrower and
sometimes have thicker walls than the more central ones. <i>Vessels are
not found</i>, but in several Mosses there is in the centre of the stem
a conducting strand of narrow, longitudinal cells, which represents
the vascular bundle in its first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> stage of development. This strand
contains elements for conveying water as well as sieve-tubes. Stomata
are entirely wanting in the sexual generation of the Leafy-Mosses; they
are found in a few Liverworts (<i>Marchantia</i>), but their structure
is not the same as in the higher plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetative reproduction</span> takes place by gemmæ or buds which
arise on the protenema, the rhizoids, the thallus, or the shoots,
and become detached from the mother-plant; or else the protonema and
the older parts of the plant simply die off, and their branches thus
become independent plants. This well-developed vegetative reproduction
explains why so many Mosses grow gregariously. In certain Marchantiaceæ
special cupules, in which gemmæ are developed, are found on the surface
of the thallus (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a> <i>A</i>, <i>s-s</i>). Again, protonema may
also arise from the leaves, and thus the leaves may act as reproductive
bodies. Certain Mosses nearly always reproduce vegetatively, and in
these species the oospheres are seldom fertilised.</p>

  </div>

<p>The first generation bears the <span class="allsmcap">SEXUAL ORGANS</span>; both kinds are
found either on the same plant (monœcious), or on separate plants
(diœcious). In the thalloid Liverworts they are often situated on the
apex of small stems (<i>gametophores</i>), springing from the surface
of the thallus. In the Leafy-Liverworts and true Mosses the leaves
which enclose the sexual organs often assume a peculiar shape, and
are arranged more closely than the other leaves to form the so-called
“Moss-flower.” The male sexual organs are called <i>antheridia</i>.
They are stalked, spheroid, club- or egg-shaped bodies whose walls are
formed of one layer of cells (Fig. <a href="#fig187">187</a>), enclosing a mass of minute
cubical cells, each one of which is a mother-cell of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> a spermatozoid.
The spermatozoids are self-motile; they are slightly twisted, with
two cilia placed anteriorly (Fig. <a href="#fig188">188</a>), while posteriorly they are
generally a trifle club-shaped, and often bear at that part the remains
of the cytoplasm, the spermatozoid itself being <i>formed from the
nucleus</i>. In the presence of water the ripe antheridium bursts, and
its contents are ejected; the spermatozoids, being liberated from their
mother-cells, swarm about in the water in order to effect fertilisation.</p>

  </div>

<p>The female sexual organs are termed <i>archegonia</i>. They
are flask-shaped bodies (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a>), the lower, swollen portion
(<i>venter</i>) having a wall, in most cases from 1–2 cells thick,
enclosing the oosphere (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a> <i>B</i>, <i>k</i>): the long neck is
formed of tiers of 4–6 cells, enclosing a central row of cells&mdash;<i>the
neck-canal-cells</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a> <i>A</i>). When the archegonium is fully
developed, the walls of the neck-canal-cells become mucilaginous and
force open the neck of the archegonium. The mucilage thus escapes, and,
remaining at the mouth of the archegonium, acts in a somewhat similar
manner to the stigma and conducting tissue of a carpel, by catching
and conducting the spermatozoids to the oosphere (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a> <i>B</i>,
<i>m</i>), with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> whose cell-nucleus they coalesce. With regard to the
formation of the oosphere, it may further be remarked that the lower
part of the archegonium originally encloses the so-called “central
cell”; but shortly before the archegonium is ripe, this cuts off a
small portion, <i>the ventral-canal-cell</i>, which lies immediately
beneath the neck, and the larger, lower portion becomes the oosphere.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The organs mentioned here, antheridia and archegonia, are
present in the Cryptogams (Pteridophyta) and the Gymnosperms.
They have always the same fundamental structure, but with slight
modifications of detail. These plants are therefore known as the
<span class="smcap">Archegoniata</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The fertilisation of the Mosses cannot be effected without water. Rain
and dew therefore play a very important part in this process, and for
this end various modifications of structure are found.</p>

<p><b>The asexual generation, the sporophyte</b> (Moss-fruit or
sporogonium). As the result of fertilisation the oosphere surrounds
itself with a cell-wall, and then commences to divide in accordance
with definite laws.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The embryo (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a> <i>C</i>) produced
by these divisions remains inside the wall <i>a-a</i> of the
archegonium (Figs. <a href="#fig190">190</a>, <a href="#fig199">199</a> <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>), and developes into
the <i>sporogonium</i>, which remains attached to the mother-plant,
often nourished by it, as if the two were one organism. The lower
extremity of the sporogonium, <i>the foot</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig190">190</a> <i>f</i>; <a href="#fig199">199</a>
<i>D</i>), very often forces its way deep down into the tissue of the
mother-plant, but without an actual union taking place. The central
portion of the sporogonium becomes a shorter or longer <i>stalk</i>
(<i>seta</i>), while the sporangium itself is developed at the summit.
At a later stage, during the formation of the spores, the sporangium
very often assumes the form of a <i>capsule</i>, and dehisces in
several ways characteristic of the various genera (Figs. <a href="#fig192">192</a>, <a href="#fig193">193</a>, <a href="#fig194">194</a>,
<a href="#fig195">195</a>, <a href="#fig200">200</a>). The basal portion of the archegonium grows for a longer
or shorter period, forming a sheath, the <i>calyptra</i>, in which
the capsule is developed, but eventually it ceases to enlarge, and
is then ruptured in different ways, but quite characteristically, in
each group. Anatomically, the asexual generation is often more highly
differentiated than the sexual; thus, for instance, stomata are present
on the sporangia of the true Mosses, but are absent in the sexual
generation.</p>

<p>As the capsule developes, an external layer of cells&mdash;the
<i>amphithecium</i>&mdash;and an internal mass&mdash;the <i>endothecium</i>&mdash;are
differentiated. As a rule the former becomes the wall of the capsule
while the latter gives rise to the spores. In this Division, as in
the Pteridophyta, the name <i>archesporium</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig190">190</a> <i>t</i>) is
given to the group of cells inside the sporangium which gives rise
to the mother-cells of the spores. The archesporium is in general a
unicellular layer; in <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Anthoceros</i> it is
derived from the most internal layer of the amphithecium, but with
these exceptions it arises from the endothecium, usually from its
most external layer. In the true Mosses and in <i>Riccia</i> only
spore-mother-cells are produced from the archesporium, but in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
majority of the Liverworts some of these cells are sterile and become
elaters (cells with spirally thickened walls, Figs. <a href="#fig196">196</a>, <a href="#fig189">189</a>), or serve
as “nurse-cells” for the spore-mother-cells, which gradually absorb the
nutriment which has been accumulated in them. In <i>Anthoceros</i>,
and almost all the Leafy-Mosses, a certain mass of cells in the centre
of the sporangium (derived from the endothecium) does not take part in
the formation of the archesporium, but forms the so called “column” or
“columella” (Figs. <a href="#fig190">190</a>, <a href="#fig191">191</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>spores</i> arise in <i>tetrads</i>, <i>i.e.</i> four in each
mother-cell, and are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, each
tetrahedron assuming the form of a sphere or a triangular pyramid. The
mature spore is a nucleated mass of protoplasm, with starch or oil as
reserve material. The wall is divided into two layers: the external
coat (exospore) which is cuticularized and in most cases coloured
(brown, yellowish), and the internal coat (endospore), which is
colourless and not cuticularized. On germination the exospore is thrown
off, the endospore protrudes, and cell-division commences and continues
with the growth of the protonema (Fig. <a href="#fig186">186</a>, <i>B-D</i>).</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The morphological explanation which Celakovsky has given of
the sporogonium, and which is not at all improbable, is, that
it is homologous with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> an embryo consisting of a very small
stem-portion and a terminal spore-producing leaf. This will be
further explained in the introduction to the Flowering-plants
(p. <a href="#Page_236">236</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>In the Liverworts the young sporogonium lives like a parasite, being
nourished by the sexual generation (only in <i>Anthoceros</i> has it a
slight power of assimilation). In the Leafy-Mosses, on the other hand,
with regard to the power of assimilation, all transitions are found
from abundant assimilation (<i>Funaria</i>, <i>Physcomitrium</i>) to
almost complete “parasitism” (<i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Andreæa</i>). In the
majority of the operculate Mosses the sporogonium has a more or less
perfect system of assimilation, and is able itself to form a large
portion of the material necessary for the development of the spores,
so that it chiefly receives from the sexual generation the inorganic
substances which must be obtained from the soil. The more highly
developed the assimilative system of the sporogonium, the more stomata
are present.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Apospory.</span> In some operculate Mosses it has been
possible to obtain a protonema with small Moss-plants from the
seta, when severed from its Moss-plant, and grown on damp sand.</p>
</div>

<p>The Mosses are the lowest plants which are provided with stem and
leaf. They are assigned a lower place when compared with the higher
Cryptogams, partly because there are still found within the Division
so many forms with a mere thallus, partly because typical roots are
wanting and the anatomical structure is so extremely simple, and partly
also because of the relation between the two generations. The highest
Mosses terminate the Division, the Muscineæ and Pteridophyta having had
a common origin in the Algæ-like Thallophyta.</p>

<p>They are divided into two classes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hepaticæ</span>, or Liverworts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musci frondosi.</span> True Mosses or Leafy-Mosses.</p>


<h3>Class 1. <b>Hepaticæ</b> (<b>Liverworts</b>).</h3>

<p>The protonema is only slightly developed. The remaining part of the
vegetative body is either a prostrate, often dichotomously-branched
thallus, pressed to the substratum (thalloid Liverworts), with
or without scales on the under side (Figs. <a href="#fig194">194</a>, <a href="#fig197">197</a>); or a thin,
prostrate, creeping stem, with distinctly-developed leaves, which
are borne in two or three rows (Figs. <a href="#fig195">195</a>, <a href="#fig198">198</a>), viz., two on the
upper and, in most cases, one on the under side. The leaves situated
on the ventral side (amphigastria) are differently shaped from the
others (Fig. <a href="#fig198">198</a> <i>a</i>), and are sometimes entirely absent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
In contradistinction to the Leafy-Mosses, stress must be laid on
the <i>well-marked dorsiventrality</i> of the vegetative organs;
<i>i.e.</i> the very distinct contrast between the dorsal side exposed
to the light and the ventral side turned to the ground. Veins are never
found in the leaves.</p>

<p>The <i>ventral part of the archegonium</i> (calyptra) continues to grow
for some time, and encloses the growing embryo, but when the spores are
ripe it is finally ruptured by the sporangium, and remains situated
like a sheath (<i>vaginula</i>) around its base. The sporangium opens,
longitudinally, by <i>valves</i> or <i>teeth</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>, <a href="#fig195">195</a>,
<a href="#fig197">197</a> <i>b</i>), very rarely by a lid, or sometimes not at all. <i>A
columella is wanting</i> (except in <i>Anthoceros</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>); but
on the other hand, a few of the cells lying between the spores are
developed into <i>elaters</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig196">196</a>), <i>i.e.</i> spindle-shaped
cells with spirally-twisted thickenings, which are hygroscopic, and
thus serve to distribute the spores. (They are seen in Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a>
<i>C</i>, not yet fully developed, as long cells radiating from the
base of the sporangium. They are wanting in <i>Riccia</i>).</p>

<p>Round the entire archegonium, (or group of archegonia, when
several are developed on the same receptacle) a sheath&mdash;the

encloses the base of the stalk of the sporangium, together
with the sheath of the archegonium (Fig. <a href="#fig195">195</a> <i>p</i>). In
the Marchantiaceæ each archegonium is enclosed in a loose
investment, the perigynium, which is developed as an outgrowth
from the cells of its stalk.</p>

thallus are found large air-chambers.</p>

and external structure mainly resembling the Marchantiaceæ.
<i>Corsinia</i>; <i>Boschia</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Marchantiaceæ</b>, are large, fleshy forms. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> surface
of the thallus is divided into small rhombic areas, in the centre of
each of which is found a large, peculiarly constructed stoma (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a>
<i>A</i>); beneath each of these a large air-cavity is to be found.
From the floor of the air-cavity a number of alga-like cells project
into it; these contain chlorophyll and are therefore the assimilating
cells. The antheridia and archegonia are each found aggregated on
specially formed branches (somewhat resembling Mushrooms) projecting
from the surface of the thallus. The antheridia are developed on the
upper surface (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>) and the archegonia on the
lower (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>), near the centrally-placed stalk.</p>

<p><i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> is diœcious (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a>), and very common

<h4>Family 2. <b>Anthoceroteæ.</b></h4>

<p>These have an entirely leafless, fleshy, flat, and
irregularly-shaped thallus. In its intercellular chambers
Nostoc-colonies are often found, which have forced their way
through the stomata situated on the under side. The antheridia
and archegonia arise from the cells lying inside the thallus.
The capsule resembles a long, thin pod; it has two valves and
a columella. <i>Anthoceros</i> (<i>A. lævis</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>, and
<i>punctatus</i>).</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 3. <b>Jungermannieæ.</b></h4>

<p>Some forms in this family have a thallus in which leaf-like
structures are found (<i>Blasia</i>), while in others (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Metzgeria</i>, <i>Pellia</i>, <i>Aneura</i>) they are entirely
absent. The majority, however, have round, thick stems, bearing
dorsally two rows of leaves, and one row ventrally. Some of these have
the leaves “underlying” (Fig. <a href="#fig195">195</a>), while in others (Fig. <a href="#fig198">198</a>) they are
“overlying.” (See Figs. <a href="#fig195">195</a>, <a href="#fig198">198</a>, with explanation).</p>

<p>The sporangia are spherical, stalked, and situated singly on the apex
of the branches, and open by four valves (in <i>Sphærocarpus</i> they
are indehiscent).</p>

<p>All the species in this family were formerly reckoned as belonging to
one genus, <i>Jungermannia</i>, but now they are divided into several,
arranged as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Anacrogynæ.</span> The archegonia are situated on the upper side
of the thallus or stem, <i>placed laterally</i>, and covered by an
“involucre,” formed by the calyptra together with the tissue of the
stem or thallus.</p>

<p>a. <span class="smcap">Anelatereæ.</span> Without any elaters: <i>Sphærocarpus</i>,
<i>Riella</i>.</p>

<p>b. <span class="smcap">Elatereæ.</span> α. Thalloid: <i>Aneura pinguis</i>, in
damp situations; <i>Metzgeria furcata</i>, on trees; <i>Pellia
epiphylla</i>, in damp situations; <i>Blasia pusilla</i>, on damp clay
soil, in the shade (scales are present on the thallus). β. Foliose and
not dorsiventral: <i>Haplomitrium hookeri</i>.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Acrogynæ.</span> The apex of the stem or of certain branches is
adapted for the formation of female shoots. The archegonia are most
frequently aggregated on the apex of the shoots, and are encircled
by their leaves (perichætium). Between these and the archegonia,
enclosing the latter, a peculiar cup-shaped organ (the involucre) is
formed. This group only includes leaf-bearing genera: <i>Frullania</i>,
<i>Radula</i>, <i>Madotheca</i>, <i>Ptilidium</i>, <i>Calypogeia</i>,
<i>Lepidozia</i>, <i>Mastigobryum</i>, <i>Lophocolea</i>,
<i>Jungermannia</i>, <i>Scapania</i>, <i>Plagiochila</i>.</p>


<h3>Class 2. <b>Musci frondosi or veri (True Mosses).</b></h3>

<p>In this class the protonema is well developed, and resembles a branched
filamentous Alga, from which it can be easily distinguished by its
oblique septa (in <i>Sphagnum</i> it is a cellular expansion). The
Moss-plant, which is developed directly from the protonema, generally
has an erect, thick, cylindrical stem similarly constructed on all
sides. The leaves are arranged spirally, the most frequent divergence
being 2/5 or 3/8 (Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a> <i>A</i>). A midrib is often present
and also marginal veins formed by longitudinally elongated cells;
at these veins the leaf is more than one layer in thickness. In
<i>Leucobryum</i> the leaves are generally constructed of more than one
layer.</p>

<p>The stem grows by means of a three-sided, pyramidal, apical cell which
gives rise to three rows of segments, each segment forming a leaf. The
lateral branches arise from the lower portions of the segments, the
upper portion of which does not take any part in the construction of
the leaf. From their mode of origin the branches are not axillary, and
differ in this respect from the Flowering-plants.</p>

<p>The ventral portion of the archegonium is very early ruptured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> <i>at
its base</i> by the growing sporogonium, upon which it remains,
and it is thus raised into the air, forming a “hood,” the calyptra
(Figs. <a href="#fig192">192</a>; <a href="#fig200">200</a> <i>B</i>). In the Sphagnaceæ the hood is not present;
in this order, as in the Liverworts, the archegonium remains at
the base of the sporogonium. The sporangium opens by circumsessile
dehiscence, the upper portion (<i>operculum</i>) being separated along
a specially constructed ring of cells, and falls off like a “lid”
(Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a>). Only in a few forms (families 2 and 3) does any variation
of this take place. Elaters are never found, but (with the exception
of <i>Archidium</i>) there is always present in the sporangium a
central mass of cells, the <i>columella</i>, which take no part in the
formation of the spores. The columella, in some, does not reach quite
to the operculum and in these cases the spore-sac is bell-shaped and
covers the columella (<i>Andreæa</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig190">190</a>; <i>Sphagnum</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig199">199</a> <i>D</i>); but in the majority of Mosses the columella extends
to the lid, so that the space containing the spores becomes a hollow
cylinder.</p>

<p>The <i>sporangium</i> is generally raised on a long stalk; in the great
majority this stalk is formed from the lower half of the oospore and
belongs to the asexual generation&mdash;it is then known as the <i>seta</i>.
In <i>Andreæa</i> and <i>Sphagnum</i> the seta is very short, and
the sporangia are raised upon a long stalk (<i>pseudopodium</i>)
developed from the summit of the sexual generation (Figs. <a href="#fig190">190</a>, <a href="#fig192">192</a>).
In the latter figure an archegonium (<i>a</i>) is seen attached to the
pseudopodium, having been carried up with this during the course of its
development. The summit of the pseudopodium is enlarged to embrace the
foot of the sporogonium (Figs. <a href="#fig192">192</a>, <a href="#fig199">199</a> <i>D</i>).</p>

<h4>Family 1. <b>Sphagneæ (Bog-Mosses).</b></h4>

<p>The protonema has been already described. The stem is regularly
branched owing to the fact that a branch, or collection of branches,
arises at every fourth leaf. These branches are closely covered with
leaves, some are erect, while others hang down and surround the stem.
No rhizoids are developed. These Mosses are of a whitish-green colour,
and when water is present are always saturated with it like a sponge,
the reason for this being found in the construction of the stem and
leaves. The stems are covered by an external layer of large clear
cells, without chlorophyll, but with annular or spiral thickenings
on the walls, which are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> perforated by large holes. By means of
capillary attraction, water is thus raised to the summit of the stem.
Similarly constructed cells are also found in the leaves, but they are
surrounded by a net of very narrow, chlorophyll-containing cells (Fig.
<a href="#fig199">199</a> <i>F</i>), whose colour is thus to a great extent lost amongst
those which are colourless. This anatomical structure is an essential
condition for the formation of peat. The Bog-Mosses grow by preference
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> moors, which they cover with a thick carpet saturated with water.
The lower extremities of the plants perish very rapidly, and gradually
become converted into peat, and the branches thus separated from each
other become independent plants. The sporangia (Fig. <a href="#fig199">199</a> <i>D</i>,
<i>E</i>) are spherical, but with a very short stalk. They open by a
<i>lid</i>, but have no <i>annulus</i>. The <i>archegonium</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig199">199</a> <i>C</i>) persists at the <i>base of the sporogonium</i> as in the
Liverworts. Only one genus, <i>Sphagnum</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h4>Family 2. <b>Schizocarpeæ.</b></h4>

<p>The Mosses which constitute this family are of a brownish-black
colour and are found living on rocks. The sporangium resembles
that of the Liverworts inasmuch as it opens by four valves, but
these continue attached to each other at the apex as well as at
the base (Fig. <a href="#fig193">193</a>).&mdash;There is only one genus: <i>Andreæa</i>.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> The stalk is formed from the lower portion of the
sporogonium. The columella is continued to the summit of
the sporangium and united with it (<i>Archidium</i> has no
columella.)</p>


<h4>Family 3. <b>Cleistocarpeæ.</b></h4>

<p>The fruit does not dehisce in the regular way, but the spores
are liberated by decay. They are small Mosses which remain
in connection with their protonema until the sporangium is
mature. The archegonium remains sessile at the base of the
short capsule-stalk, and is not raised into the air (compare
Hepaticæ).&mdash;<i>Phascum, Ephemerum, Archidium, Pleuridium.</i></p>
</div>


<h4>Family 4. <b>Stegocarpeæ.</b></h4>

<p>To this belong the majority of the Mosses, about 3,000 species.</p>

<p>The capsule opens as in <i>Sphagnum</i> by means of a <i>lid</i>
(<i>operculum</i>), which is often prolonged into a beak. Round the
mouth of the opened capsule, a number of peculiar yellow or red
teeth are to be found. These constitute the <i>peristome</i>; their
number is four, or a multiple of four (8, 16, 32 or 64). The form and
thickenings of these teeth are widely different, and on this account
are used by Systematists for the purposes of classification. In some
Mosses (Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>) there is a double row of teeth.
Except in <i>Tetraphis</i> they are not formed from entire cells, but
from the strongly thickened portions of the wall of certain layers of
cells belonging to the lid, and persist when this falls off. They are
strongly hygroscopic, and assist greatly in the ejection of the lid, in
which operation they are considerably aided by a ring of elastic cells
with thickened walls, situated in the wall of the lid near the base of
the teeth. This ring is known as the <i>annulus</i>. The archegonium is
raised into the air like a hood, the calyptra, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> either covers the
sporangium on all sides (having the shape of a bell), or is split on
one side (Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a> <i>B</i>, <i>h</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among peculiar forms may be mentioned: <i>Splachnum</i>, which
is especially remarkable for the collar-like expansion at the
base of the capsule. <i>Fissidens</i> deviates in having a flat
stem and leaves arranged in two rows. The leaves are boat-shaped
and half embrace the stem.&mdash;<i>Schistostega</i> has two kinds of
stems. The barren ones resemble Fern-leaves; they have two rows
of leaves, which are attached together vertically, are decurrent
and coalesce at their bases. The fertile ones have an ordinary
appearance.&mdash;<i>Tetraphis</i>: the peristome is composed of four
teeth, which are formed from entire cells. <i>T. pellucida</i>
has peculiar gemmæ.</p>
</div>

<p>The family is divided into two groups: the Musci acrocarpi, the growth
of whose main axis is limited and terminated by the formation of the
sexual organs; and the Musci pleurocarpi, whose sporogonia are situated
on special lateral shoots, while the growth of the main axis is
unlimited.</p>

Arctic regions the Mosses are very plentiful, and often form a
considerable part of the vegetation, while in the Tropics they
are insignificant.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">DIVISION III.<br />
<span class="subhed">PTERIDOPHYTA (VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS).</span></h2></div>

<p>The alternation of generations is as distinct in this Division as
in the Mosses, but the sexual generation consists of only a small
thallus, the prothallium, which bears directly the sexual organs,
<i>antheridia</i> and <i>archegonia</i>; and the asexual generation,
which arises from the fertilisation of the oosphere, is no longer
a single short-lived sporangium, but a highly developed, generally
perennial, plant provided with stem, leaves and <i>true roots</i>
(Ferns, Horsetails, etc.), the sporangia being borne on the leaves. In
this latter generation the tissues are differentiated into epidermis,
ground tissue and vascular tissue; in the last named the bundles are
closed, and in the majority of cases concentric.</p>

<p>The <b>sexual generation</b>, <b>gametophyte</b>, or
<b>prothallium</b>, is <i>always a thallus</i>, although not always
green and leaf-like (Figs. <a href="#fig205">205</a>, <a href="#fig215">215</a>, <a href="#fig222">222</a>, <a href="#fig229">229</a>, <a href="#fig235">235</a>, etc.) It is very
small, even in cases where it attains the greatest development, and
consists only of parenchymatous cells. The prothallium is nourished by
hair-like roots (rhizoids) and has only a transitory existence, dying
soon after the fertilisation of its oosphere.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">ANTHERIDIA</span> exhibit great variations in structure which,
however, must be considered as modifications of the fundamental type
which is found in the Mosses. These modifications will be mentioned
under the various families. The <i>spermatozoids</i> are always
spirally-coiled, self-motile, protoplasmic bodies, with most frequently
a large number of fine cilia on the anterior end (Figs. <a href="#fig206">206</a>, <a href="#fig223">223</a>, <a href="#fig234">234</a>).
They are formed principally from the nucleus of the mother-cell, and
portions of the cytoplasm often remain for a time attached to their
posterior end.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">ARCHEGONIA</span> are more uniform throughout the entire
Division, and more closely resemble those of the Mosses. They are, as
in the previous Division, principally flask-shaped; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> central
portion, which encloses the oosphere, is always embedded in the tissue
of the prothallium, so that the neck, which is formed of 4 rows of
cells, projects above the surface (Figs. <a href="#fig201">201</a> <sup>3</sup>, <a href="#fig222">222</a> <i>h</i>). The
development of the archegonium in a Fern is seen in the accompanying
figure (Fig. <a href="#fig201">201</a>). The archegonium is developed from a surface cell,
which divides into three cells by two walls in a direction parallel
to the surface of the prothallium (Fig. <a href="#fig201">201</a>). The most internal cell
becomes the ventral portion of the archegonium. The external one
(<i>b</i>) divides perpendicularly to the surface of the prothallium
into four cells, which again divide parallel to the surface and form
the neck (<i>b</i>, in 2 and 3). The intermediate cell projects upwards
into the neck and divides into two, the lower one, after the separation
of the ventral canal-cell, becoming the <i>oosphere</i>, and the upper
one the <i>neck-canal-cell</i> (<i>c</i>, in 2 and 3).</p>

of archegonia.]</p>
  </div>

<p>As in the Mosses, the divisional walls of the neck-canal-cells become
mucilaginous, causing the rupture of the neck of the archegonium.
Fertilisation takes place as in the Mosses, and the passage of the
spermatozoids, along the neck, to the oosphere, has been observed.
Water (rain or dew) is similarly necessary for the movements of the
spermatozoids, and hence for fertilisation. The other classes of the
Division chiefly deviate from the Ferns in having the archegonium sunk
deeper into the prothallium, and the neck reduced in length (compare
Fig. <a href="#fig201">201</a> with Figs. <a href="#fig216">216</a>, <a href="#fig222">222</a>, <a href="#fig235">235</a>, <a href="#fig236">236</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>

<p>According to the nature of the spores, the three classes of the
Vascular Cryptogams are each divided into isosporous and heterosporous
groups.</p>

<p>I. The <b>isosporous</b> Vascular Cryptogams have <i>only one kind
of spore</i>. The prothallium developed from this is in some cases
monœcious, bearing both antheridia and archegonia; but in others there
is a distinct tendency for each prothallium to bear only antheridia or
archegonia (diœcious)&mdash;true Ferns and <i>Lycopodium</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Equisetum</i> there is only one kind of spore, but two kinds of
prothallia are developed, one of which bears only antheridia (male),
the other only archegonia (female); but the one that bears antheridia
may be transformed into the one that bears archegonia and vice versa.</p>

<p>II. In the higher group, <b>heterosporous</b> Vascular Cryptogams
(<i>Selaginella</i> and <i>Isoëtes</i>, etc.), there are two distinct
kinds of spores, the <i>small</i>, microspores, and the <i>large</i>,
macrospores. The <i>microspores</i> are male, and produce prothallia
which bear only antheridia. The <i>macrospores</i> are female, and
produce prothallia which bear only archegonia.</p>

<p>Corresponding to this difference in the spores, there is also found
a difference in the development of the prothallium. In the Isosporeæ
the prothallium is large, and either green, leaf-like, and provided
with rhizoids (most of the Ferns, Horsetails, etc.), or subterranean,
pale-coloured, and globular (<i>Ophioglossum</i>, <i>Lycopodium</i>).
It lives vegetatively for a fairly long time, and generally produces a
large and varying number of archegonia and antheridia. The prothallium
in the Heterosporeæ is gradually more and more reduced, its independent
and vegetative life becomes of less and less importance, it becomes
more dependent on the mother-plant, and projects from the spore very
slightly, or not at all. The antheridia and archegonia become reduced
in number to one, and also degenerate in point of development.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that the gradual development of the asexual
generation, the development of the two kinds of spores, and the
progressive reduction of the prothallium and sexual organs which
is found in this Division, is continued to the Gymnosperms and
Angiosperms. The microspores are in these called pollen-grains, and
the male prothallium is very rudimentary. The macrospores are termed
embryo-sacs, and the female prothallium, the endosperm.</p>

<p>The <b>asexual generation</b>, <b>sporophyte</b>. When the oosphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
which in this case as in all others is a primordial cell, is
fertilised, it surrounds itself with a cell-wall and commences to
divide into a number of cells, to form the embryo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first dividing wall (basal wall) is nearly horizontal, and
in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the archegonium.
The next wall is vertical, and the next perpendicular to the
other two. The oosphere, therefore, is now divided into eight
octants by these three walls. The basal wall divides the
embryo into a hypobasal and an epibasal half. From the first
one, by continued divisions, the first root is developed; from
the latter, the stem and leaves. After the formation of the
octants the development proceeds in somewhat different ways in
the various classes. In addition to the stem, leaf, and root,
a “foot” is developed from the hypobasal half which remains
enclosed in the prothallium, and conveys nourishment from the
prothallium to the young plant until it is able to sustain
itself (Fig. <a href="#fig202">202</a>). The formation of these members in the embryo
depends on the position of the oosphere in the archegonium and
prothallium, and is independent of gravity.</p>

<i>æ</i> unfertilised archegonia.</p>
  </div>

<p>In the Mosses the asexual generation is the sporogonium, which is
limited in its development and in a great measure dependent upon the
sexual generation, upon which it is situated; but in the Pteridophyta
this generation is an independent and highly developed plant, provided
with stem, leaf, and true roots, and has in many instances an unlimited
development. The Pteridophyta are the lowest Division with <i>true
roots</i>. The root which is first formed is very similar in nature
to the primary root of the Monocotyledons; it very soon dies and is
replaced by others which are more permanent, and developed upon the
stem (adventitious roots); roots are wanting in <i>Salvinia</i>,
<i>Psilotum</i>, and some Hymenophyllaceæ. The differentiation is,
however, not so complete as in the Flowering-plants, and so many
leafy forms are not found. The various members of these plants are
anatomically much higher than in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> Mosses, having an epidermis,
a ground tissue with variously differentiated cells, and a highly
developed vascular system. The vascular bundles, like those in the
Monocotyledons, are without cambium, and closed; they are therefore
incapable of any increase in thickness. In general the bundles are
concentric, with the bast round the wood (Fig. <a href="#fig203">203</a>). The wood is almost
entirely made up of scalariform tracheides.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In <i>Isoëtes</i> a secondary thickening takes place by a
cambium, which is formed inside the cortex, constructing
secondary cortex to the exterior, and secondary wood towards
the interior.&mdash;<i>Botrychium</i> has also a thickening growth.
Collateral vascular bundles occur in <i>Osmundaceæ</i>,
<i>Equisetaceæ</i>, and the leaves of many <i>Polypodiaceæ</i>,
etc.</p>

is seen the transverse section, with vascular bundles of different form
and size. The rhombic figures on the side of the stem are leaf-scars.</p>
  </div>

<p>It is a point of special interest, that the gigantic forms of Ferns,
Equisetums, and Club-Mosses (which flourished in earlier geological
periods, when these classes attained their highest development)
possessed some means of increasing in thickness.</p>

<p>The <i>sporangia</i> are in all cases <i>capsule-like</i>, and
burst open when ripe to eject the spores. They are nearly always
situated on the leaves (in <i>Lycopodiaceæ</i>, in the axils of the
leaves, or above these, on the stems themselves). In some forms
(<span class="smcap">Leptosporangiatæ</span>), the sporangia are developed from a single
epidermal cell; in others (<span class="smcap">Eusporangiatæ</span>), from a group of
epidermal cells, or from cells which lie beneath the epidermis. In the
first group a primitive mother-cell (archesporium) is formed, which
divides commonly into sixteen special mother-cells. In the latter
group, on the other hand, a number of primitive spore-mother-cells are
developed. In each sporangium three different tissues are generally
developed; an innermost <i>sporogenous</i> one (<i>s</i> in Fig.
<a href="#fig204">204</a> <i>A</i>), which arises from the archesporangium; an outermost
one, which forms the <i>wall</i> (<i>a</i>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> and may be one or,
more rarely, several layers in thickness; and an intermediate one,
the <i>tapetum</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig204">204</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>b t</i>),
which is rich in protoplasm, and whose cells are dissolved so that
the spores float freely in the fluid thus provided. The spores arise
as in the Mosses (in tetrads), by the cross-division of the special
mother-cells, and according to the manner in which they are arranged
in the mother-cell have either a tetrahedral form, with a large base
resembling a segment of a ball, or are oblong (bilateral spores). Their
construction is the same as in the Mosses (p. <a href="#Page_187">187</a>).</p>

<i>A</i> A young sporangium, which may develope either into a macro-,
or a microsporangium. <i>B</i> A microsporangium.</p>
  </div>

<p>The spore-formation in its earliest commencement takes place in the
same way in the Isosporous and the Heterosporous Vascular Cryptogams;
but from a certain point, after the tetrahedral division, a difference
occurs with regard to the macrosporangia. All the spores formed in the
microsporangium may complete their development; but those which are
formed in the macrosporangium are generally aborted, with the exception
of one or four, and these consequently attain a much larger size (see
Fig. <a href="#fig239">239</a>.&mdash;The series to the left are microsporangia; those to the
right, macrosporangia).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Apogamy.</span> In some Ferns (<i>Pteris cretica</i>;
<i>Aspidium filix mas</i>, var. <i>cristatum</i>; <i>A.
falcatum</i>; <i>Todea africana</i>) the young plant is not
developed as a consequence of fertilisation, but as a bud from
the prothallium. This is known as apogamy, or loss of the power
of sexual reproduction. The antheridia are generally more or
less developed; archegonia are entirely wanting in <i>Asp. filix
mas</i>, var.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> <i>cristatum</i>. This variety has probably
only become apogamous through cultivation. Many specimens of
<i>Isoëtes lacustris</i>, in a lake in the Vosges mountains,
produce in the place where the sporangia are usually found,
a vegetative shoot which grows into a new plant, so that the
sexual generation is wanting in this case. Some specimens have
sporangia on some leaves, and shoots on others.</p>

<p>Apospory, or the formation of prothallia instead of sporangia
and spores on the leaves, is found in <i>Athyrium filix
femina</i>, var. <i>clarissimum</i>. In this case the
development of the sporangia proceeds only to a certain point,
and from these arrested sporangia the prothallia are produced.
Normal sporangia are entirely wanting in this variety, and in
<i>Aspidium angulare</i>, var. <i>pulcherrimum</i>, sporangia
are completely wanting. Compare the Mosses (page 188).</p>
</div>

<p>The Vascular Cryptogams are divided into <i>three large classes</i>,
in each of which a progressive development can be traced from the
isosporous to the heterosporous forms, but some of these are now only
known as fossils.</p>

<p>Class 1. <b>Filicinæ</b> (<b>Ferns</b>).&mdash;The stem is small in
comparison with the leaves, and branches only seldom, and then by
lateral shoots. The leaves are scattered, large, often deeply divided,
and of various highly developed forms. The undeveloped leaves are
rolled up in the bud, having what is termed circinate venation. The
sporangia are situated on the edge or on the lower side of the leaves,
those on which the sporangia are borne (<i>sporophylls</i>) being often
the ordinary foliage-leaves; but in a few cases the fertile differ from
the barren ones (a higher stage in development). The fertile leaves
are not confined to definite parts of the shoot, and do not limit its
growth. The archesporium is most frequently unicellular.</p>

<p><i>A</i>. <b>Isosporous</b>: Sub-Class 1. Filices (True Ferns).</p>

<p><i>B</i>. <b>Heterosporous</b>: Sub-Class 2. Hydropterideæ (Water
Ferns).</p>

<p>Class 2. <b>Equisetinæ</b> (<b>Horsetails</b>), in its widest
meaning.&mdash;The leaves in this class are small in comparison with the
stem. They are arranged in whorls, and unite to form a sheath. The
sporangia are situated on specially modified, shield-like leaves,
which are closely packed together and form a “cone.” The cone is
borne terminally, and limits the growth of the shoot. The sporangia
are developed from a large group of epidermal cells, the archesporium
being unicellular. The branches are arranged in whorls, and develope
acropetally.</p>

<p><i>A</i>. <b>Isosporous</b>: Sub-Class 1. Equisetaceæ. Existing forms.</p>

<p><i>B</i>. <b>Heterosporous</b>: Sub-Class 2. Extinct forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span></p>

<p>Class 3. <b>Lycopodinæ</b> (<b>Club-Mosses</b>).&mdash;Roots generally
branching dichotomously. The leaves are scattered or opposite, and in
proportion to the stem very small, undivided, and simple. They are
scale-like and triangular, tapering from a broad base to a point. The
sporangia are situated singly (except in <i>Psilotaceæ</i>), and almost
in every case on the upper side of the leaf or in the axil of a leaf;
but in some cases they are borne on the stem, just above the leaf-axil.
The sporangia arise from groups of epidermal cells. The sporophylls
are often modified, and differ from the foliage-leaves; they are then
arranged in cones placed terminally on branches, thus limiting their
growth.</p>

<p><i>A</i>. <b>Isosporous</b>: Sub-Class 1. Lycopodieæ.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> <b>Heterosporous</b>: Sub-Class 2. Selaginelleæ.</p>


<h3>Class 1. <b>Filicinæ</b> (<b>Ferns</b>).</h3>

<p>The characteristics of this class have already been given on page <a href="#Page_204">204</a>.</p>

<p>The class is divided into two sub-classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">True Ferns</span>, <span class="smcap">Filices</span>, have one kind of
spore which generally developes monœcious prothallia, relatively
large and green. The sporangia are most frequently situated in
groups (<i>sori</i>), which are often covered but not enclosed by an
<i>indusium</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Water Ferns</span>, <span class="smcap">Hydropteridæ</span>, have microsporangia
with many (4 × 16) microspores, and <i>macrosporangia, each with one
macrospore</i>. The prothallium is small, and projects but slightly
from the germinating spore. The sporangia are situated in groups
(<i>sori</i>), which are either enclosed by an indusium, or enveloped
in a portion of a leaf, to form “fruits” termed <i>sporocarps</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The old name for the Hydropterideæ, “Rhizocarpeæ,” <i>i.e.</i>
the “root-fruited,” originated from the erroneous supposition
that the sporocarps were borne on the roots.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="smaller">Sub-Class 1. <b>Filices</b> (<b>the True Ferns</b>).</h3>

<p>Of the eight orders (with about 4,000 species) comprised in this
sub-class, the Polypodiaceæ is the largest (having about 2,800 species)
and the most familiar; for this reason it will be taken as typical.</p>

<p><b>The sexual generation.</b> When the spore germinates, the external
covering (exospore) is ruptured, as in the Mosses. The internal
cell-wall (endospore) grows out as a filament, which soon divides and
gives rise to the prothallium, a flat, cellular expansion resembling
the thallus of a Liverwort. In its fully developed state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> the
prothallium is generally heart-shaped, dark green, and provided with
root-hairs, and it attains a diameter of about one centimetre (Fig.
<a href="#fig205">205</a>). It is formed of one layer of cells, except along the central
line near the anterior depression, where it becomes several layers
of cells in thickness, forming the “cushion,” on the lower side of
which the archegonia are developed. The antheridia are first formed;
they are thus found on the oldest parts of the prothallium, on its
edge, or among the root-hairs. The archegonia are developed later,
and are therefore found near the apex. Several tropical Ferns have
prothallia<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> deviating from this typical form; <i>Trichomanes</i>
(Order <i>Hymenophyllaceæ</i>) has filamentous, branched prothallia,
which resemble the protonema of a Moss. Others, again, have
strap-shaped prothallia, which resemble the thallus of certain
Liverworts.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">ARCHEGONIA</span> have been already mentioned (p. <a href="#Page_199">199</a>, Fig. <a href="#fig201">201</a>).
The <span class="allsmcap">ANTHERIDIA</span> are hemispherical or slightly conical bodies
(Fig. <a href="#fig206">206</a>). They consist, as in the Mosses, of a wall formed by one
layer of cells, which encloses a number of spermatozoid-mother-cells
(<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). The antheridia when ripe absorb water, and are
ruptured, and the spirally-coiled spermatozoids liberated (Fig. <a href="#fig206">206</a>
<i>S</i>). The spermatozoids have been observed to pass down the neck
of the archegonium, and to fuse with the oosphere.</p>

<p><b>The asexual generation.</b> The first leaf, the “cotyledon,” of the
embryo developed from the oospore (Figs. <a href="#fig202">202</a>, <a href="#fig205">205</a>) is always small,
and has a very simple shape. The leaves which occur later become more
perfect, stage by stage, until the permanent form of leaf has been
attained.&mdash;The <span class="allsmcap">STEM</span> is most frequently a subterranean or a
semi-aerial rhizome; it is only in the tropical, palm-like Tree-Ferns,
that the stem raises itself high in the air and resembles that of a
tree, with leaf-scars or with the remains of leaves attached (Figs.
<a href="#fig207">207</a>, <a href="#fig203">203</a>); in certain species the stem is encased in a thick mat
of aerial roots (<i>Dicksonia antarctica</i>). When the rhizome is
horizontal the internodes are frequently elongated, and the leaves
are arranged in two rows, as in <i>Polypodium vulgare</i> and in the
Bracken-Fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>), etc.; it is also generally
<i>dorsiventral</i>, having a dorsal side on which the leaves are
situated, and a ventral side, different from the former, on which the
roots are borne. When the stem ascends in an oblique direction, or is
nearly vertical, its internodes are extremely short, and the leaves are
arranged in a spiral line with a complicated phyllotaxis, <i>e.g.</i>
in <i>Athyrium filix-fœmina</i>, <i>Aspidium filix-mas</i>, etc. The
<span class="allsmcap">BRANCHING</span> upon the whole is extremely slight, and is generally
confined to the petiole (<i>e.g. Aspid. filix-mas</i>), or to
the stem near the insertion of the leaves. Several species normally
form buds on different parts of the lamina. The buds which are formed
on the stem are not confined to the leaf-axil as in the higher plants.
The Tree-Ferns, generally, do not branch at all.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">VASCULAR BUNDLES</span> are <i>concentric</i>, with the wood
surrounded by the soft bast. In transverse section they are seen
as circles or irregularly-shaped figures (Fig. <a href="#fig203">203</a>), the name
of “King Charles and the Oak” (Bracken-Fern) having originated
from the appearance which the bundles present in oblique section.
In <i>Osmunda</i> they are collateral and resemble those of the
Flowering-plants. Round each individual bundle is often a sheath of
thick-walled, hard, brown, sclerenchymatous cells, which act as a
mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> tissue; similar strands are also found in other parts of
the stem.</p>

     <p class="p0 sm center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 207.</span>&mdash;Various Ferns (1, 2, 3, 4).</p>
  </div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">LEAVES</span> in nearly all species are only foliage-leaves,
borne in a spiral. They have an apical growth which continues for
a long time, and some require several years for their complete
development. In the buds they are rolled up (<i>circinate</i>); not
only the midrib, but also all the lateral veins, and even the terminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
portions of a leaf are sometimes rolled up together, the tissues of
the leaf being already fully developed and only waiting to expand.
The leaves are often excessively divided and compound, with pinnate
branches, and have an epidermis with stomata and a well-developed
system of venation. Stipules are only found in <i>Marattiaceæ</i> and
<i>Ophioglossaceæ</i>.</p>

<p>Very often peculiar hairs or scales (<i>paleæ</i>, <i>ramenta</i>),
dry, brown, flat and broad, are found on stem and leaf.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SPORANGIA</span> are small, round capsules, which, in a very
large number of Ferns, are formed on the back, but more rarely on the
edge of the ordinary foliage-leaves. It is very seldom that there
is any difference in form between the barren foliage-leaves and the
fertile leaves, as is found for example in <i>Blechnum spicant</i>
or <i>Struthiopteris</i>; or that the fertile part of the leaf is
differently constructed from the barren portion of the same leaf, as in
the Royal-Fern (<i>Osmunda</i>). In such instances the mesophyll of the
fertile parts is poorly developed.</p>

<p>The sporangia in the <i>Polypodiaceæ</i> are lens-shaped, with long
stalk (Fig. <a href="#fig211">211</a> <i>D</i>): their wall consists of one cell-layer on
which a single row of cells, passing vertically over the top (that
is along the edge of the sporangium), is developed into the “ring”
(annulus). The cells of the annulus are very much thickened on the
inner and side walls, and are yellowish-brown. The thickened cells,
however, do not entirely encircle the sporangium, and on one side, near
the stalk, they pass over into large, flat, thin-walled cells. These
form a weak point in the wall, and it is here that the sporangium is
opened diagonally by the elongation of the annulus. The sporangium of
the Polypodiaceæ opens as it dries. The cells of the annulus are very
hygroscopic, and in straightening, the annulus bends back with a jerk,
thus ejecting the spores to considerable distances. The cells of the
annulus absorb water with great readiness. [The sporangium arises as
a single epidermal cell, from which a basal stalk-cell is cut off.
Three oblique cell-walls, intersecting near the base, are next formed
in the upper cell, and a fourth between these and parallel to the free
surface; an inner tetrahedral cell enclosed by four others is thus
formed, the outer cells become the wall of the sporangium, while the
inner cell, by a series of walls, parallel to its sides, cuts off a
layer of cells which eventually form the tapetum, the remaining central
cell constituting the archesporium.]</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SPORES</span> are either oblong and bilateral, or they are
tetrahedric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> with curved sides, depending upon the way in which the
tetrad division has taken place.</p>

<p>The sporangia are almost always situated on the nerves and gathered
into groups, <i>sori</i>, which differ in form in the various genera.
The sori, in many genera, may be covered by a scale-like structure, the
<i>indusium</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig211">211</a> <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig212">212</a>).</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, each sorus is situated on a small papilla
(<i>placenta</i>, or <i>receptacle</i>), which is supplied by a small
vascular bundle. Between the sporangia, hairs (<i>paraphyses</i>) are
often situated, which spring either from the placenta or from the
stalks of the sporangia.</p>

<p><b>Systematic Division.</b> The Ferns may be divided into two groups,
characterized by the structure and development of the sporangia. The
sporangia in the <span class="smcap">Eusporangiatæ</span> take their origin from a group
of epidermal cells, and their walls are formed by several layers of
cells. The archesporium is the (not tetrahedric) hypodermal terminal
cell of the axial row of cells which give rise to the sporangium. In
the <span class="smcap">Leptosporangiatæ</span> the sporangia are developed from single
epidermal cells, and their walls are uni-layered. The archesporium is a
central, often tetrahedric cell, from which sixteen spore-mother-cells
are developed.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is difficult to say which form is the oldest
(according to Prantl, those which have the sori on the nerve-endings);
however, the Eusporangiatæ would seem to have made their appearance
long before the others, and also well defined Marattiaceæ and
Ophioglossaceæ occur in the Kulm and Coal period, before the true
Polypodiaceæ.</p>

<p>About 4,000 species of Ferns are now existing, and they are found
especially in tropical and sub-tropical forests.</p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Eusporangiatæ.</b></h4>

<p>Order 1. <b>Ophioglossaceæ.</b> The prothallium differs from that
of all other Ferns in being <i>subterranean</i>, <i>free from
chlorophyll</i>, <i>pale</i> and <i>tuberous</i>. The stem is extremely
short, with short internodes, most frequently unbranched, vertical,
and entirely buried in the ground (Fig. <a href="#fig208">208</a> <i>st</i>). In several
species (among which are the native ones) one leaf is produced every
year, which has taken three to four years for its development. In
<i>Botrychium</i> a closed, sheath-like basal part of each leaf covers
the subsequent leaves during their development. In <i>Ophioglossum</i>
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> others each leaf has at its base an intrapetiolar, cap-like
sheath, which protects the succeeding leaf. The leaves are of two
kinds: (<i>a</i>) foliage, which in <i>Ophioglossum vulgatum</i> are
lanceolate and entire, but in <i>Botrychium</i> however, are pinnate
(<i>b</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig208">208</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>); and (<i>b</i>) fertile,
which are found facing the upper side of the foliage-leaves. These
latter in <i>Ophioglossum</i> are undivided and spike-like (Fig. <a href="#fig209">209</a>
<i>A</i>), but pinnate in <i>Botrychium</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig208">208</a> <i>B</i>). Each
foliage and fertile leaf are branches from the same petiole. The large
sporangia are placed laterally, and open by two valves. No annulus is
formed (Fig. <a href="#fig209">209</a>).&mdash;<i>Ophioglossum</i> reproduces vegetatively by
adventitious buds on the roots.</p>

<p>Three genera with about twelve species.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Marattiaceæ</b> are tropical Ferns, whose gigantic leaves
resemble those of the Polypodiaceæ, but have stipules in addition.
The sporangia are grouped in sori, situated on the lower side of the
leaves, the sporangia in each sorus being arranged either in two
rows or in a ring. In <i>Angiopteris</i> they are isolated (Fig. <a href="#fig210">210</a>
<i>A</i>), but in the other species (<i>Kaulfussia</i>, <i>Danæa</i>,
<i>Marattia</i>), they are united, and form “synangia” divided into
a number of chambers corresponding to the sporangia. These open by
clefts or pores. <i>Marattia</i> presents the highest development,
as its sporangia are completely united in a capsule-like synangium,
which is closed until maturity, and then opens by two valves. In each
valve there is a row of three to eleven sporangia, each opening by a
slit towards the inside (Fig. <a href="#fig210">210</a> <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>). An indusium
encloses the sorus, except in <i>Kaulfussia</i>; it is formed of flat
and lobed hairs, which resemble the hairs of the other portions of the
leaves. In <i>Angiopteris</i> and <i>Marattia</i> the indusium is very
rudimentary; in <i>Danæa</i> it forms a kind of cupule.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The numerous fossil Marattiaceæ (15 genera, with 98 species)
present similar differences to those now living, but more
various forms are found, for example, with solitary free
sporangia. Those now living are the last small remnant (4 genera
with only 23 species) of a once dominant family, which existed
from very early times, and whose culminating point was reached
in the Kulm and Coal periods.</p>

<p>The Ophioglossaceæ appear also in the Kulm and Coal periods,
and were about as numerous as at the present time (presumably 2
genera, with 19 species). Leptosporangiate Ferns appear however
to have occurred first of all in the Trias-formation.</p>

of the sori, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>1. The sporangia cover the entire lower surface of the leaf (Tropical
America and Asia). <i>Acrostichum</i>, <i>Platycerium.</i></p>

<p>2. Sori without indusia, circular or oval. <i>Polypodium</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig211">211</a> <i>A</i>). The leaves are most frequently situated in two rows
on the dorsal side of the creeping rhizome, and fall off leaving a
smooth scar behind.&mdash;<i>P. vulgare</i>, common in woods, on stones.
(<i>Phegopteris</i> also has no indusium; see page <a href="#Page_214">214</a>).</p>

<p>3. The sporangia are situated in continuous lines just inside the
margin of the leaf.&mdash;<i>Pteris</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>: the sporangia form a continuous
line along the entire margin of the leaf (Fig. <a href="#fig211">211</a> <i>C</i>), which
bends over and covers the sporangia, forming a “false-indusium.”
<i>Pteridium</i> has linear sori situated on a marginal vascular
bundle, covered by two linear basal indusia, of which the outer is bent
over like the edge of a leaf.&mdash;<i>P. aquilinum</i> (Bracken) has a
wide-spreading rhizome with large alternate leaves, placed on opposite
sides, at some distance apart. Only one leaf is developed from each
branch every year.</p>

sporangium and its mode of attachment and development, and in
the differences in the formation of the prothallium, etc. The
principal are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Hymenophyllaceæ.</b> To this order belong the lowest
and most Moss-like Ferns; the leaves, with the exception of
the veins, are most frequently formed of <i>only one layer of
cells</i>, and consequently stomata are wanting; the formation
of the prothallium also somewhat resembles the Mosses. Sori
marginal, on the <i>extremities of the vascular bundles</i>,
and surrounded by a <i>cupular indusium</i>. The sporangia
are sessile, with equatorial annulus. <i>Hymenophyllum</i>
(<i>H. tunbridgense</i>, European). <i>Trichomanes</i> (<i>T.
speciosum</i>, European). Species about 200, which live
especially on rocks and trees in damp and shady tropical
forests. Some have no roots.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Cyatheaceæ.</b> Annulus <i>complete</i> and oblique.
To this order belong, principally, the tree-like Ferns with
palm-like habit. The number of species is about 200, they are
all tropical and form forests in some regions of Australia.
<i>Cibotium</i> and <i>Dicksonia</i> have marginal sori, with
cupular, basal indusium. (The stem of <i>D. antarctica</i> is

  </div>

<p><b>Sexual generation.</b> The <span class="allsmcap">MICROSPORES</span> produce an extremely
rudimentary prothallium, formed of only a single cell, and having
also a very much reduced bicellular antheridium with a small number
of spermatozoid mother-cells in each cell (in <i>Salvinia</i> 4, in
<i>Marsilia</i> and <i>Pilularia</i> 16). In <i>Salvinia</i> the
microspores remain embedded in a hard mucilaginous mass (at first
frothy) which fills up the cavity of the sporangium. The prothallium
must therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> grow out through this slime and also through the wall
of the sporangium (Fig. <a href="#fig214">214</a>), and it thus terminates in a relatively
long cell.</p>

<p>In <i>Marsilia</i> the microspores are set free from the
microsporangium, and the prothallia, with the antheridia, remain
in them until the spermatozoids are liberated. The latter are
spirally-twisted threads.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">MACROSPORES</span>, on germination, give rise to a very reduced
prothallium, which in <i>Salvinia</i> bears 3 archegonia; but, if these
are not fertilised, the prothallium may continue to grow and become a
fairly large, green body with several archegonia (Fig. <a href="#fig215">215</a> <i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>). In <i>Marsilia</i> the prothallium is still more reduced,
it is enclosed in the macrospore, and only bears one archegonium. The
archegonia are similar in structure to those of the Ferns, but are
smaller, and sunk more deeply in the tissue of the prothallium.</p>

  </div>

<p><b>The asexual generation</b> is developed from the fertilised
egg-cell. It is a dorsiventral, horizontal shoot. In <i>Salvinia</i>
it bears at first a shield-like leaf, the scutiform leaf (Fig. <a href="#fig215">215</a>
<i>C</i>, <i>a</i>), which is succeeded by the ordinary foliage-leaves.
The young plants of <i>Marsilia</i>, likewise, have less perfect leaves
in the very early stage.</p>

<p>The formation of the sporangium is the same as in the Leptosporangiate
Ferns. (The 16 spore-mother-cells originate from one central,
tetrahedric archesporium.)</p>

<p>The Hydropterideæ are divided into 2 orders, the chief differences

<p>Order 1. <b>Salviniaceæ.</b> This order more nearly approaches the true
Ferns, especially so on account of the form of the indusium. Only one
species is found in Europe, <i>Salvinia natans</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a>). This
is a small, floating, annual, aquatic plant, entirely <i>destitute
of roots</i>. The dorsiventral, horizontal stem bears two kinds of
leaves, which are arranged in whorls of three. Two of these which turn
upwards are oval, entire, “<i>aerial foliage-leaves</i>” (Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a> B,
<i>b<sup>2</sup></i>-<i>b<sup>3</sup></i>); the third, the “<i>water-leaf</i>” (<i>b<sup>1</sup></i>)
is submerged and divided into a number of hair-like segments, similar
to the submerged leaves in many aquatic plants, for instance,
Water-buttercup (see also Fig. <a href="#fig215">215</a> <i>C</i>). The whorls of leaves
alternate with each other; there are thus 4 rows of dorsally-placed
aerial leaves, and two rows of ventrally-placed submerged leaves. The
sporangia are situated in sori, each sorus being borne on a small
column (receptacle or placenta) and enveloped by a <i>cupular</i>, but
<i>entirely closed indusium</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig218">218</a>). <i>The sori are situated
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> the submerged leaves</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a> <i>B</i>, <i>s-s</i>) <i>and are
unisexual</i>, <i>i.e.</i> each sorus contains microsporangia only, or
macrosporangia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Azolla</i> belongs to this order. It is a very small,
floating, tropical water-plant (America and East India), with
horizontal, root-bearing stem. The stem branches profusely by
lateral buds, and bears the two rows of leaves on its dorsal
side, the roots on the ventral side. Each leaf is bifid, and
divided into an upper dorsal, and a lower ventral portion.
The upper segments float on the surface of the water and
are arranged like tiles on a roof, each one overlapping its
neighbour. In each floating segment a large cavity is found, in
which <i>Anabæna</i> is always present. The lower segments are
submerged.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Marsiliaceæ.</b> The characteristic feature of this
order, and one not possessed by other Fern-like plants, is that the
sori (2–many) are enveloped <i>in leaf-segments</i> which <i>close
round them</i> and form a “sporocarp,” just in the same manner as the
carpels, in the Angiospermous Flowering-plants, close round the ovules
and form ovaries. The sori contain both micro-and macrosporangia. When
the spores are ripe, the sporocarp opens in order to disperse the
spores (Fig. <a href="#fig220">220</a>).</p>

  </div>

<p>The two genera (with 57 species, Temperate, Tropics) are land-and
marsh-plants, whose dorsiventral, creeping stem bears roots on the
under surface, and the leaves in two rows on the upper side (Figs.
<a href="#fig219">219</a>, <a href="#fig221">221</a>). The leaves of <i>Marsilia</i> are compound, and divided
into four small leaflets springing from the apex of the petiole (Fig.
<a href="#fig219">219</a>), and resemble the leaves of <i>Oxalis</i>. In the bud the leaves
are circinate (Fig. <a href="#fig219">219</a> <i>b</i>), and at night they exhibit the
well-known sleep-movements. The sporocarps are borne on the petioles
of the fertile leaves, near their bases (Fig. <a href="#fig219">219</a> <i>f</i>); they
are oblong and resemble small beans, the outer cells being hard and
sclerenchymatous, while the inner ones are divided into a number of
loculi arranged in two rows. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> germination, water is absorbed, the
two sides separate slightly, as valves (Fig. <a href="#fig220">220</a> <i>A</i>), and a
long vermiform mass of gelatinous, parenchymatous cells (Fig. <a href="#fig220">220</a>),
swollen by the water, emerges, bearing a large number of sori arranged
pinnately. Each sorus (<i>sr</i>) is covered by a thin indusium. (The
thin covering may be considered an indusium physiologically, though not
morphologically).</p>

  </div>

<p><b>The sexual generation.</b> The prothallium is green and leaf-like,
as in the majority of Ferns, but irregularly branched and curled. It
is often unisexual. The male prothallia bear antheridia only, and
are smaller and less branched (Fig. <a href="#fig222">222</a> <i>A</i>) than the female;
the latter may attain a diameter of ½ an inch, and bear archegonia
only (Fig. <a href="#fig222">222</a> <i>B</i>). The antheridia and the archegonia resemble
those of the Ferns, but the spermatozoids (Fig. <a href="#fig223">223</a>) are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> larger and
less twisted. On the last curve is situated a more or less elongated
appendage of cytoplasm (Fig. <a href="#fig223">223</a> <i>c</i>).</p>

<p><b>The asexual generation.</b> The embryo is similar to that of the
Ferns. The fully developed <i>Equisetum</i> is a perennial herb, with
widely creeping (in some species tuberous) rhizome, from which extend
erect, aerial, most frequently annual shoots.</p>


  <div class="figcenter" id="fig224" style="width: 600px">

fertile branch with cone; <i>b</i> vegetative shoot; <i>c</i> cone;
<i>d</i> sporophylls.</p>
  </div>

<p>The vegetative aerial <span class="allsmcap">STEMS</span> are divided into a number of
internodes by the whorls of leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a>). The internodes are
hollow, the cavities being separated from each other by the transverse
partitions of the solid nodes. The lower portion of the internode,
which is encased by the leaves, has much thinner and softer cell-walls,
so that the stem is easily separated into segments just above the
nodes. Each internode has a large number of ridges and furrows,
and bears at its apex a whorl of leaves whose number and position
correspond to the ridges of the internode. As in the case of other
verticillate plants, the whorls are placed alternately, one above
the other; the same arrangement is also found in the ridges on two
successive internodes. In addition to the large air-cavity in the
centre of each internode (the central cavity), a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> whorl of tubular
air-passages is found in the cortex of the stems, opposite the furrows
(vallecular canals). There is also a similar air-passage (carinal
canals) in each of the vascular bundles, which are placed in a ring,
one opposite each ridge, and therefore alternating with the vallecular
canals. The vascular bundles are <i>collateral</i> as in the majority
of Flowering-plants, but poorly developed. The xylem of each bundle
consists of two groups of annular or spiral vessels, close to the outer
border of the carinal canal, and two groups of scalariform tracheides,
each placed on a radius passing through a group of spiral vessels.
The phloëm is placed between these four groups, each of which has
only a few vessels. The stiffness of the stems is mainly due to the
large amount of silica in the cell-walls of the epidermis, and to the
sclerenchymatous cells of the ridges.</p>

<p>All <span class="allsmcap">LEAVES</span> are situated in <i>whorls</i>. The
<span class="allsmcap">VEGETATIVE</span> are simple, undivided, 1-nerved, and are united
into toothed sheaths (Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a> <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). The branching
of the stems in some species (<i>E. arvense</i>) is very abundant.
The branches break through the base of the leaf-sheaths (Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a>
<i>b</i>), and generally <i>alternate with the teeth</i> (leaves).</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">FERTILE LEAVES</span> (<i>sporophylls</i>) are different from
the barren ones. They are <i>free, shield-like</i>, each one having a
short stalk bearing usually an hexagonal plate (Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a> <i>d</i>),
and closely compressed into an ear or cone (Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a> <i>a</i>,
<i>c</i>). The <i>Equisetums</i> thus present an advance in development
distinctly beyond that of the Ferns, which is further emphasized by
the circumstance that a transition from the sheath-leaves to the
fertile-leaves is found in the involucre or annulus, a “collar” of
specially modified leaves situated at the base of the cone (Fig.
<a href="#fig224">224</a> <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>). The cone may be considered as a very
rudimentary flower, and the annulus may be regarded as a very early
stage in the formation of a flower (perianth). See page <a href="#Page_235">235</a>.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SPORANGIA</span> are situated on the underside of the
sporophylls, one at each angle; they are sac-like, and open inwardly
by a longitudinal cleft (Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a> <i>d</i>). An annulus is wanting;
but in the wall of the sporangium, as in the pollen-sacs of the
Flowering-plants, a layer of cells, with annular or spiral thickenings,
is developed, which assists in the dehiscence of the sporangium.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SPORES</span> are green; the walls composed of four distinct
layers, of which the outer is gradually separated, except at one point,
and becomes split into four long bands (<i>elaters</i>) (Fig. <a href="#fig225">225</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
The elaters are extremely hygroscopic, coiling round the spore when
moistened, and expanding as soon as dry, presenting a most lively
object under the microscope when breathed upon and allowed to dry. The
second layer, when germination commences, becomes detached from the
inner wall, which is formed of the exospore and endospore.</p>

<p>The order has become much reduced, and at the present time includes
only one genus, <i>Equisetum</i>, with about twenty-five species,
which are distributed over the entire globe, particularly in damp
situations. In <span class="allsmcap">SOME SPECIES</span> the barren shoots are green and
very much branched, but the fertile ones are unbranched, pale brown,
and possess no chlorophyll (<i>E. arvense</i>, Field-Horsetail, Fig.
<a href="#fig224">224</a>, and <i>E. maximum</i>). <span class="smcap">In others</span> the fertile and barren
shoots are alike green, and either both unbranched (<i>E. hiemale</i>),
or branched (<i>E. palustre</i>, <i>E. limosum</i>, etc). The fertile
shoots of <i>E. silvaticum</i>, up to maturity, resemble those without
chylorophyll of <i>E. arvense</i>, but after that period they produce
green branches, and thus resemble the barren ones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Extinct isosporous Equisetinæ.</span> In addition to several
true species of fossilized <i>Equisetums</i>, the order of
the <span class="smcap">Calamites</span>, which no doubt is closely allied to
the Equisetinæ, is also found in the fossil state. These were
gigantic forms, attaining about twenty times the size of
those of the present day, and stems of nearly 10–12 metres in
height are known. They reached the culminating point of their
development in the Carboniferous period, and died out towards
the close of the Palæozoic. The stems had hollow internodes and
alternating grooves, similar to their relatives of the present
day. The leaves must either have been absent or very perishable,
since they have not been identified with certainty. If the
determinations of certain remains of cones which of late have
been discovered are correct, they were heterosporous and had
two kinds of sporangia as in the following sub-class. A cambium
formation and an increase in thickness has been found in the
stems.</p>

<p>Their <span class="allsmcap">USES</span> are very limited. A few species, such as
<i>E. hiemale</i> are used for polishing on account of the hard
siliceous cell-walls of the epidermis, found in all species of
<i>Equisetum</i>.</p>

characteristics, that the verticillate leaves are not united

subterranean portion, with either little or no chlorophyll; and

<p>Order 1. <b>Isoëtaceæ (Quill-worts).</b> The only known genus,
<i>Isoëtes</i> (Quill-wort), has an extremely short, tuberous,
<i>unbranched</i> stem with very short internodes (Fig. <a href="#fig237">237</a>).
The <span class="allsmcap">STEM</span> is remarkable as being the only one among the
Vascular Cryptogams which increases in thickness (see page <a href="#Page_202">202</a>).
The meristematic cells are situated round the axial cylinder, and
form, especially, parenchymatous tissue in two or three directions,
giving rise to 2–3 grooves in which the dichotomously-branched
<span class="allsmcap">ROOTS</span> are produced. The <span class="allsmcap">LEAVES</span> are arranged spirally
in a close rosette.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> They are awl-shaped and have at the base a
semi-amplexicaul sheath, with a groove (<i>fovea</i>), in which a
sporangium is situated (Fig. <a href="#fig238">238</a>). The ligule is a foliar outgrowth
from the upper edge of the groove.&mdash;The <span class="allsmcap">MACROSPORANGIA</span> (each
with a number of macrospores), are situated on the outer leaves, the
<span class="allsmcap">MICROSPORANGIA</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig238">238</a>), on the inner ones. Between each
cycle of fertile leaves there are a number of imperfect or barren ones
as in the case of the female plant of <i>Cycas</i>. The spores are
liberated by the decay of the sporangium. The two kinds of sporangia
develope at the commencement in the same way. The archesporium is, at
first, a hypodermal layer of cells which grow out in the direction
perpendicular to the surface of the leaf, and divide by a number
of walls parallel to this direction, forming a sporogenous mass of
cells. Some of the cell-rows of this sporogenous mass lose their
rich protoplasmic contents, and are arrested in their growth; thus
incomplete divisional walls of sterile cells, “<i>trabeculæ</i>”
arise in the sporangium, dividing it into a number of compartments
one above the other (Fig. <a href="#fig238">238</a> <i>t</i>). (The trabeculæ, according to
Goebel, play the same part as the nutritive cells of the sporangium
of <i>Riella</i>; the tapetal cells, as in the Ferns, are in a great
measure dissolved at a later period.) The sporogenous cell-rows, in
the microsporangia, give rise to a large number of spore-mother-cells,
but in the macrosporangia only one spore-mother-cell, with tapetum, is
developed from each fertile archesporial cell.</p>

<p>The two native species, and several others, are aquatic plants, the
remaining species are land plants, or are amphibious. About 50 species.
In temperate and tropical regions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fossil</span> species in the
Tertiary period.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Selaginellaceæ.</b> This order contains only one genus,
<i>Selaginella</i>. The <span class="allsmcap">STEM</span>, in the majority of species, is
dorsiventral, long and slender, and apparently branches dichotomously,
but in reality <i>monopodially</i>, with well developed lateral shoots.
The <span class="allsmcap">LEAVES</span> are small, round, or ovate, in the majority of
species arranged in whorls of two leaves each; these whorls, however,
are not decussate, but are considerably inclined towards each other,
an arrangement by which four rows of leaves are produced, each whorl
having one large and one small leaf. The two leaves in each whorl are
of unequal size, the smaller one being placed on the upper surface and
the larger on the lower surface of the stem (Fig. <a href="#fig240">240</a>). Some species
have spirally-arranged leaves, more resembling the arrangement in the
<i>Lycopodiums</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smaller">FERTILE LEAVES</span> most frequently differ from the barren
ones, and are collected into spike-like cones (a kind of flower;
Fig. <a href="#fig239">239</a>). Micro-and macrosporangia are found in the same cone (Fig.
<a href="#fig239">239</a>). Each sporangium arises from a group of superficial cells of
the stem, directly over the leaf on which it will be situated later
on. Each sporangium has a hypodermal, unicellular archesporium, and
contains a layer of tapetal cells; these are dissolved later, when
the spores are ripe, and not before as in the Ferns. In the very
early stages of their development, the micro-and macrosporangia are
precisely similar, and the differences between them arise later on.
In the microsporangium all the spore-mother-cells divide, and each
forms four tetrahedrically-arranged microspores (Fig. <a href="#fig204">204</a>); but in the
macrosporangium only four macrospores are formed, by the division of
a <i>single mother-cell</i>, while the remaining spore-mother-cells
are aborted. It is rarely that the macrosporangia contain 2 or 8
macrospores.</p>

The prothallium arises in the macrospore (<i>f-f</i>, in Fig.
<a href="#fig235">235</a> <i>A</i>), probably by division of the meniscus-shaped
protoplasmic mass, which is marked off at the apex of the spore;
primordial cells are thus formed which later on are surrounded
by a cell-wall. In six to seven weeks after sowing, the
spore-wall is ruptured by the growing prothallium, which already
has developed archegonia (Fig. <a href="#fig235">235</a> <i>œ-œ</i>). The prothallium
so formed does not occupy the entire cavity of the spore, but
four to five weeks after sowing, the large-celled parenchyma
is developed in the lower portion of the spore by free
cell-formation; this has been termed by Pfeffer, “endosperm,”
since it is similar to the endosperm of Flowering-plants.
Goebel, however, has termed it “secondary prothallium,” as the
homology with the endosperm of the Angiosperms is very doubtful.</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smaller">FERTILISED OOSPHERE</span> divides into an upper (hypobasal)
and a lower (epibasal) cell; from the latter alone the embryo is
developed with its root, stem, foot, and two <i>cotyledons</i>, and
the former gives rise to an organ which appears in this instance for
the first time, but which occurs in all Flowering-plants, viz. the
<i>suspensor</i>. This forces the embryo down into the “endosperm,”
which is entirely or partially absorbed by the embryo. In the case of
the Flowering-plants the embryo is developed with its longitudinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
axis in the elongation of the suspensor, but in <i>Selaginella</i> the
embryo is situated <i>transversely</i> to it.</p>

species living in the North (<i>S. spinulosa</i>), but others grow in
Central and South Europe.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Lepidodendraceæ</b> are extinct, tree-like
Lycopods, which are found especially in the Lower and Middle
Carboniferous. Vegetatively they are most nearly related to
<i>Lycopodium</i>, but the stem attained much larger proportions
(about eleven metres in height and one metre in thickness),
and had a cambium by which it increased in thickness. It was
regularly dichotomous, and closely studded with spirally-placed
leaves, which left behind them peculiar rhombic scars. The large
cones resemble Pine-cones, and bore sporangia much larger than
any which are now produced (the male ones as much as 2 cm.’s in
length). The macrosporangia were situated at the base, and the
microsporangia at the apex.</p>

<p>Order 4. <b>Sigillariaceæ.</b> These are, presumably, another
group of extinct tree-like Lycopods (especially in the Middle
Carboniferous). The name has been derived from the seal-like
scars, which the fallen leaves have left behind in longitudinal
rows on the grooved stem. The rhizomes of these plants were
formerly termed <i>Stigmaria</i>, and placed in a separate genus.</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Sphenophyllaceæ</b> form an entirely extinct
group. They do not definitely belong to any of the three large
classes of Vascular Cryptogams, but it is perhaps best to
place them in juxtaposition to these. They were herbaceous
plants with verticillate, wedge-shaped leaves, with nerves
branching dichotomously into equally strong branches. Micro-and
macrosporangia were formed in the same cone; and were situated
in the axils of the leaves, as in the Lycopods.</p>

<h3 class="smaller"><b>The Transition from the Cryptogams to the Phanerogams.</b></h3>
</div>


<p>All the plants considered in the preceding chapters are included
in the term <span class="smcap">Cryptogams</span>; all in the following chapters
under the head of <span class="smcap">Phanerogams</span> (see page <a href="#Page_3">3</a>). Hofmeister’s
pioneer works (1851, <i>Vergleichende Untersuchungen der höheren
Kryptogamen</i>, etc.) and the numerous researches published later
by other investigators, have closed the gap which was formerly
thought to exist between these plants; so that we now, in the series:
Bryophyta&mdash;Pteridophyta&mdash;Gymnospermæ&mdash;Angiospermæ see the expression of
a single line of development in accordance with a definite plan. The
forms through which this gradual development has taken place have in
course of time, however, to a great extent died out, and only single
links of the chain connecting the lowest to the highest still remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The alternation of generations</span>, which we found indicated in
certain Thallophytes, can be proved with the greatest clearness in
all the higher Cryptogams, from the Mosses upwards; it is also found
in the Phanerogams, but not in such a pronounced degree, because one
of the generations is so far reduced that it has almost given up its
independence. For the sake of greater clearness, we will begin with the
comparison of the sporophyte, asexual (second) generation.</p>


<p class="center p1"><b>The asexual (2nd) generation of the Cormophytes.</b></p>

<p>The asexual generation which follows from the further development of
the fertilised oosphere, is, in the <i>Mosses</i>, only the sporogonium
(according to one theory it is perhaps homologous with a spore-bearing
leaf, situated upon a short stem, see p. <a href="#Page_187">187</a>); in <i>Filicinæ</i>,
<i>Equisetinæ</i>, and <i>Lycopodinæ</i>, on the other hand, it is a
highly developed plant differentiated into stem, leaf, and true root,
and bearing the sporangia on its leaves. The <span class="smaller">MODIFICATION OF THE
SHOOT</span> is very slight in <i>Filicinæ</i>. The first leaves of the
embryo are very simple in form (Fig. <a href="#fig205">205</a>), but after a certain age all
the leaves which arise are essentially alike. The fertile leaves do
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> differ from the barren ones, and are found associated with them,
and their formation does not limit the growth in length of the stem. It
is only in a few of the true Ferns, and in the Hydropterideæ, that the
fertile leaves differ considerably from the barren ones. A division of
labour in which certain leaves are set apart for nutrition, and others
for reproduction, is found more pronouncedly in the <i>Equisetinæ</i>
and <i>Lycopodinæ</i>, for in these groups, with a few exceptions, the
fertile and barren leaves are very dissimilar; the former are collected
in special ear-like <i>cones</i>, which <i>terminate the further
growth</i> of the short stems on which they are borne. In connection
with the cone, leaves are sometimes developed which form a transition
from the barren to the fertile ones (the “annulus” in Equisetaceæ),
and in these cases the first indication of a flower with perianth
or floral-leaves is to be traced. Among the Cryptogams the highest
division of labour is found in <i>Selaginella</i> and <i>Isoëtes</i>,
which have the two kinds of sporangia borne on <i>different</i>
leaves. The division of labour (modification) is, however, still
more pronounced in the <i>Phanerogams</i>: the leaves which bear the
microsporangia (“pollen-sacs”) have quite different forms from those
which bear macrosporangia (the “nucellus” in the ovule), the former
are termed <i>stamens</i>, the latter <i>carpels</i>; in certain
instances, too, there is even a contrast between the “male plants”
and the “female plants.” Moreover, a division of labour, in a much
greater degree, takes place in the leaves which do not directly take
part in reproduction, and it is thus possible in many plants to draw
a sharp line not only between stamens and carpels, but also between
four or five distinct kinds of leaves, which differ in <i>form</i>,
<i>structure</i>, and corresponding <i>functions</i>, and which appear
in regular sequence on the shoot: namely, between “scale-leaves” and
“foliage-leaves,”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> both of which occur in the Cryptogams, and the
“floral-leaves,” including the bracts and leaves of the “perianth,”
which latter often differ from each other in form and colour,
and are then separated into <i>sepals</i> and <i>petals</i>. The
<i>leaves</i>&mdash;stamens and carpels&mdash;<i>which bear the sporangia</i>
are termed sporophylls, and the shoot, or extremity of a shoot, whose
leaves are modified into sporophylls, is <i>terminated in its further
growth by their production, and is known as a flower</i>. The flower
which is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> completely furnished has calyx, corolla, stamens,
and carpels arranged in this order. If the only sporophylls present
are stamens, then it is said to be a <i>male</i> (<i>staminate</i>)
flower, and if only carpels, then a <i>female</i> (<i>pistillate</i>)
flower, and in both these cases the flowers are <i>unisexual</i>, or
diclinous. If stamens and carpels are both present in the same flower,
it is termed <i>hermaphrodite</i>. Diclinous plants in which the female
flowers are situated on one plant, and the male flowers on another, are
termed <i>diœcious</i>; and those in which the same plant bears the two
kinds of flowers are termed <i>monœcious</i>. When the male, female,
and hermaphrodite flowers are found in the same species, the plant is
said to be <i>polygamous</i>.</p>

<p><b>The sporangia-bearing leaves&mdash;Sporophylls.</b> In the Mosses the
asexual generation is only represented by the sporogonium, and if the
theory is correct which considers the sporogonium to be an embryo
consisting of a rudimentary stem and terminal leaf, then the spores are
produced on the leaves in these plants. The sporangia in the Filicinæ
are situated in groups (sori) on the back or on the edge of the leaves.
The number of sporangia in the sorus diminishes very greatly in the
Marattiaceæ and Gleicheniaceæ (three to four in the latter, Fig. <a href="#fig213">213</a>).
In the Equisetinæ the sporangia are situated in a small number on the
underside of shield-like leaves, and in Lycopodinæ, singly, in the
axils of the fertile leaves, which are alike and bear either micro- or
macrosporangia. In the Phanerogams there is a great difference between
the stamens and carpels.</p>

<p><b>Stamens.</b> In the lowest Phanerogams (<i>Cycadeæ</i>) there
are many indications of relationship to the Ferns. The stamens
are flat and broad, and have <i>on the back many pollen-sacs</i>
(<i>microsporangia</i>) arranged in small groups (true <i>sori</i>),
which even have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> a small “placenta,” similar to the one possessed
by the Ferns, and open towards the inside by a longitudinal cleft
(Fig. <a href="#fig241">241</a>, compare Fig. <a href="#fig213">213</a>). A section of the <i>Coniferæ</i> agree
more closely with the Equisetaceæ, in having a few (three to eight)
pollen-sacs arranged on the underside of more or less shield-like
leaves (Figs. <a href="#fig242">242</a>, <a href="#fig243">243</a>, compare with Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a> <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>d</i>). In the Abietaceæ the number of sporangia is diminished
to two, which are placed also on the lower side (Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>) of a
stamen. The number of <i>pollen-sacs</i> (microsporangia) in the
<i>Angiosperms</i> is nearly always four to each stamen; they are
longitudinal projections which are placed in pairs on each side
of the central line of the stamen, two on the edge, and the other
two generally on the side which is turned inwards; the pollen-sacs
generally dehisce longitudinally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> (quadrilocular anthers, Fig. <a href="#fig244">244</a>).
A few, for instance Orchidaceæ and Asclepiadaceæ, have only two
pollen-sacs (bilocular anthers); and in others, such as <i>Solanum</i>
and the Ericaceæ, they open by pores; in Lauraceæ and Berberidaceæ, by
valves. The part of the stamen which bears the pollen-sacs is termed
the <i>anther</i>. Most frequently this is supported by a stalk known
as the <i>filament</i>.</p>

  </div>

<p><b>Carpels.</b> The simplest forms of carpels are found in
<i>Cycas</i>. In this genus both the foliage and fertile leaves
are pinnate, and hence present great similarity; the ovules
(macrosporangia) are situated on the margin of the central portion,
just as the sporangia are placed on the edge of the fertile leaf of
<i>Ophioglossum</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig245">245</a>, compare with Fig. <a href="#fig209">209</a>). The carpels of
the other Cycadeæ present greater divergence from the foliage-leaves,
being peltate, for instance, in <i>Zamia</i> and <i>Ceratozamia</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig246">246</a>). The ovules in the Coniferæ are situated on the upper
side and near the base of the ovuliferous scales, almost in the same
position as the sporangia in the Lycopodinæ (Figs. <a href="#fig269">269</a>, <a href="#fig272">272</a>, <a href="#fig273">273</a>
<i>H</i>, compare Figs. <a href="#fig230">230</a>, <a href="#fig239">239</a>). In <i>Taxus</i> the uninclosed
ovule is placed on the apex of a shoot (Fig. <a href="#fig264">264</a>). In all these plants
the ovules are <i>not enclosed</i> by the carpels, that is, they are
not enclosed in chambers formed by the turning in of the walls of the
carpel, and hence the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> <i>Gymnospermæ</i> is given to them. In
the higher Flowering-plants, the <i>Angiospermæ</i>, the ovules are
distinctly situated on the edge, the upper surface, or base of the
carpel; but the carpel closes round the ovules which are therefore
enclosed in a chamber&mdash;the <i>ovary</i>. In a few cases, for example
in the Polygonaceæ, an ovule is situated apparently on the apex of the
stem itself, as in the Yew; in other cases, as in the Primulaceæ, many
ovules are apparently developed on the apex of the stem, which seems
to have been specially adapted as a placenta, but it is also possible
and correct in these cases to suppose that the ovules are in reality
developed on the carpels.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A single fully-developed carpel or a
collection of carpels joined together is termed the <i>pistil</i>. The
extremity of the carpel, which is specially developed to catch the
pollen-grains and form a suitable nidus on which they may germinate,
is called the <i>stigma</i>. The united edges of a carpel which bear
the ovules are termed the <i>ventral suture</i>. The back of the carpel
forms the <i>dorsal suture</i>. The Marsiliaceæ take a position among
the Hydropterideæ analogous to that occupied by the Angiosperms; the
sporangia are in a corresponding manner enveloped in a closed leaf.</p>

<p>The collection of stamens in a flower is termed the <i>andrœcium</i>,
and all the carpels, whether individually free or united into one
pistil, the <i>gynœceum</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Sporangia</b>. The asexual generation of the <i>Mosses</i>
is the sporogonium, in which the spores arise in tetrads from the
mother-cells. The sporangia in the <i>Filicinæ</i> take their origin
either from a single cell (Leptosporangiatæ) or, what probably
may be regarded as an older stand-point, from a group of cells
(Eusporangiatæ). In both cases there may be distinguished in a
mature sporangium three tissues, which have different significance
(Fig. <a href="#fig204">204</a>): (1) an external layer, the <i>sporangium-wall</i>,
most frequently composed of one layer of cells made up of cells of

the tapetum (<i>t</i>), external to the tapetum is the anther-wall,
which is still far from being fully developed. The sub-epidermal layer
becomes “fibrous,” and the cells lying inside it become dissolved,
together with the tapetum.</p>
  </div>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Phanerogams</span> the <b>Microsporangia</b> are termed
<b>Pollen-sacs</b>. They take their origin from a large group of cells,
which, in the Angiosperms, lie immediately beneath the epidermal
cells of the anther. In the developed, but not yet mature, sporangium
(pollen-sac) there are to be found: (as in the Vascular Cryptogams)
(1) an internal group of mother-cells which give rise to the
<i>pollen-grains</i> (<i>microspores</i>), in this case also formed in
tetrads; (2) a group of cells surrounding these, of which the internal
ones form a <i>tapetal layer</i>, similar to that in the Vascular
Cryptogams; the tapetum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> and some of the cells surrounding it in this
group, become dissolved before maturity; the more external ones, on
the other hand, are provided with peculiar thickenings, and form the
“fibrous” layer by the aid of which the dehiscence of the anther takes
place; (3) an external layer, the epidermis, enclosing all the other
layers (Fig. <a href="#fig247">247</a>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In some Coniferæ (<i>Cupressus</i>, <i>Thuja</i>, and several
species of <i>Juniperus</i>) the microsporangia (pollen-sacs),
which are situated on the under side of the stamen, are covered
by a thin structure which seems to be a continuation of the
lamina and which is supposed to be homologous with the indusium
of the Ferns.</p>

  </div>

<p><b>The Ovule</b> in the Phanerogams arises most frequently on a
projecting portion of the carpel, termed the <i>placenta</i>. The
ovules (compare the sporangium of the Eusporangiatæ and especially
the pollen-sac) take their origin from a <i>group of cells which
lies beneath the epidermis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig248">248</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>). First
of all a small papilla is formed, which is later on provided with a
<i>vascular bundle</i> and becomes the <i>funicle</i>; this probably
has the same value as the projections (“placenta”) on which the sori
in the Ferns are attached. Only <i>one</i> <b>macrosporangium</b>
(<i>nucellus</i>; Fig. <a href="#fig248">248</a> <i>nc</i>) is developed at the apex of
the funicle. This arises by a process of cell-division exactly
corresponding to that by which the pollen-sacs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> are formed (Fig.
<a href="#fig248">248</a> <i>C-E</i>), with this difference only, that while a great
<i>many</i> cells may be distinguished in each pollen-sac, which forms
pollen-grains by tetrad-division, only a few are found in the ovule,
and all these moreover are <i>suppressed, with one single exception</i>
which developes into the <b>macrospore</b> (<b>embryo-sac</b>) without
undergoing a division into tetrads. The wall of the embryo-sac, in
the Gymnosperms, may be thick and divided into two layers and partly
cuticularized, as in the spores of the Cryptogams which are to be set
free. In the Angiosperms, on the other hand, the wall is extremely thin.</p>

<p>The pollen-sac thus stands in the same relation to the nucellus as the
microsporangium does to the macrosporangium: in the pollen-sacs and
microsporangia a <i>number</i> of spores arise by the tetrad-division
of several mother-cells; in the nucellus and macrosporangium,
a reduction of the cells already formed takes place to such an
extent that the number of macrospores becomes one (<i>Salvinia</i>,
<i>Marsilia</i>, Phanerogams) or four (<i>Selaginella</i>), or rarely a
large number as in <i>Isoëtes</i>.</p>

<p>In the Ferns, as stated on page <a href="#Page_210">210</a>, etc., <i>indusia</i> covering the
sori very often occur. Horsetails and Club-Mosses have no indusium; but
in all Phanerogams cupular or sac-like structures (<i>integuments</i>)
are found which envelop the nucellus. These develope from the upper
end of the funicle (<i>ii</i> and <i>ie</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig248">248</a>; <i>y</i>
and <i>i</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig249">249</a>) and enclose the nucellus on all sides as
a sac, leaving only a small channel at the apex of the nucellus&mdash;the
<i>micropyle</i>&mdash;(Fig. <a href="#fig249">249</a>) through which the pollen-tube proceeds to
the embryo-sac. The ovules of the Gymnosperms have only one integument
(Figs. <a href="#fig251">251</a>, <a href="#fig264">264</a>, <a href="#fig269">269</a>, <a href="#fig274">274</a>) and the same is the case with the majority
of the Sympetalæ and a few Choripetalæ; but the Monocotyledons and most
of the Choripetalæ have two integuments (Fig. <a href="#fig249">249</a>).</p>

<p>In shape the integuments resemble very closely the cupular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> indusium
of the Hymenophyllaceæ, certain Cyatheaceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig212">212</a> <i>E</i>), and
<i>Salvinia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig218">218</a>); that they are really homologous with
these is probable, but is not proven. Some authorities regard them as
structures found only in the Phanerogams.</p>

<p>The ovule is thus a “<i>monangic</i>” (<i>i.e.</i> reduced to 1
sporangium, the <i>nucellus</i>) <i>sorus</i>, situated on a funicle,
and enclosed by one or two cupular <i>indusia</i>, the integuments.

<i>curved</i> (<i>campylotropous</i>), the majority <i>reversed</i>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Goebel (1884 and earlier) with Strasburger considered the
entire ovule of the Phanerogams as homologous with the
macrosporangium, the integuments however as new structures in
contradistinction to the Ferns: the funicle then corresponds
to the stalk of the sporangium. The integuments of the ovule
(according to Goebel, 1882) differ from the indusium of the
Fern-like plants in being developed from the basal portion of
the nucellus and are not, as in the Ferns and <i>Isoëtes</i>,
a portion (outgrowth) of the leaf which bears the sporangia
(<i>K</i>).]</p>
</div>

<p>The nucellus is the only macrosporangium which never opens; <i>the
macrospore remains enclosed in it</i>, and <i>the macrosporangium
remains attached to the mother-plant</i>. It is therefore essential
that the <i>method of fertilisation</i> which is employed should be
very different from that of the Cryptogams. <i>The pollen-grains must
be transferred to the ovule</i>, and retained either by a drop of
mucilage at the micropyle (Gymnosperms) or by the stigma on the carpels
(Angiosperms). Fertilisation by spermatozoids, which are freely motile
in water, is abandoned in the Phanerogams.</p>

<p>Many other modifications, unknown in plants of more simple structure,
take place, for instance, in the shoots which bear the fertile leaves;
especially in the form of the stem or <i>thalamus</i> (hypogynous,
perigynous, epigynous); in the development of the perianth which stands
in intimate connection with the special means employed to effect
fertilisation; with respect to the different grades of union found
in the leaves; in the union of the flowers into aggregations of a
higher order (inflorescences), and at the same time the production of
“floral-leaves” (page 235).</p>


<p class="center p1"><b>The sexual generation. The Fertilisation.</b></p>

<p>The sexual generation in the <i>Mosses</i> is relatively well
developed, because not only the protonema, but all the other vegetative
parts of the Moss-plant, in addition to the archegonia and antheridia,
belong to it. In the groups which follow, a gradual but increasing
reduction of the sexual generation takes place, and at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> same
time an indication of sex is found in the prothallia, which finds
expression in the forms of the spores themselves. In the majority of
cases among the <i>isosporous</i> Vascular Cryptogams, the sexual
generation&mdash;prothallium&mdash;is a green, leafy expansion which can sustain
itself by the assimilation of carbonic acid, and by the absorption
of nutriment from the soil by means of root-hairs. In some plants
(<i>Ophioglossaceæ</i>, <i>Lycopodium annotinum</i>) the prothallium
is a subterranean, pale, tubercular body, but in these instances it is
relatively large. In the <i>heterosporous</i> Vascular Cryptogams and
in the <i>Phanerogams</i>, the prothallium is much more reduced, both
as regards its size, and also with respect to the number and structure
of the antheridia and archegonia.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Microspores.</b> The <span class="allsmcap">PROTHALLIUM</span> in all Vascular
Cryptogams which have unequal spores, consists of a single, vegetative
(barren) cell, which plays a very unimportant part in the life of the
prothallium (Fig. <a href="#fig233">233</a> <i>A</i>). In <i>Salvinia</i> it is somewhat
elongated and tubular, because it must break through the sporangium
(Fig. <a href="#fig214">214</a>); but in other cases it is very small and lenticular. In
all these plants only one antheridium is formed. In <i>Salvinia</i>
it consists of 2 cells whose walls are ruptured in order that the
spermatozoids may be liberated (Fig. <a href="#fig214">214</a> <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>). In
<i>Marsilia</i>, <i>Isoëtes</i>, and <i>Selaginella</i> the prothallium
does not leave the spore, and consists for the most part of primordial
spermatozoid-mother-cells <i>without cell-wall</i>, which on
germination are ejected so that the spermatozoids are set free.</p>

<p>In the Phanerogams, the microspores have from olden times been termed
<i>pollen-grains</i>.</p>

<p>In the <span class="allsmcap">GYMNOSPERMS</span> the prothallium is reduced to 1, 2 or 3
small cells, placed on one side of the mature pollen-grain (at the
top in Fig. <a href="#fig250">250</a> <i>I</i>, <i>II</i>, and in Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a> <i>N</i>) and
which do not play any part in the germination of the pollen-grain. The
antheridium is represented by the remaining portions of the interior of
the pollen-grain, that is, it consists of a large cell with a nucleus
which does not even go so far as the antheridium of <i>Selaginella</i>
and become divided into spermatozoid-mother-cells without cell-wall,
for even these cells are not formed. The unicellular antheridium
grows, on the germination of the pollen-grain, into a tubular body
known as the <i>pollen-tube</i>, formed from the inner wall of the
pollen-grain (Fig. <a href="#fig250">250</a>), which works its way down the micropyle to
the oosphere. The fertilisation takes place by diosmosis through the
cell-wall, and consists here also of the coalescence of the nucleus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> of
the pollen-tube (the sperm-nucleus, male pronucleus) with that of the
oosphere.</p>

<p>In the <span class="allsmcap">ANGIOSPERMS</span> the reductions proceed still further.
The barren cell, which represents the prothallium, was in the last
group separated from the antheridium by a true cell-wall, but in the
Angiosperms a membrane at most, but no firm cell-wall, is formed. The
pollen-grain contains two cells, a vegetative and a free generative
cell. Both these pass into the pollen-tube, but the vegetative
cell disappears about the time the pollen-tube reaches the ovule;
while the generative cell divides into two: one, the sperm-nucleus
coalescing with the nucleus of the oosphere, the other being absorbed
(<i>Lilium</i>, after Guinard).</p>

<p>The Gymnosperms prove in yet another point that they are more
closely related to the Cryptogams than are the Angiosperms. When the
pollen-grain begins to germinate the external wall ruptures as in the
Cryptogams (Fig. <a href="#fig250">250</a>), but in the Angiosperms special germ-pores are
formed in the cell-wall for the emergence of the pollen-tube.</p>

  </div>

<p>2. <b>The Macrospores.</b> The prothallium in <i>Salvinia</i> and
<i>Marsilia</i> is still rather large, green, and capable of the
independent assimilation of carbon. It projects more or less from the
macrospore and bears (in <i>Marsilia</i> only one, in <i>Salvinia</i>
several) archegonia, which however are embedded to a greater degree in
the prothallium, and are more reduced than the archegonia of the true
Ferns and Horsetails (Figs. <a href="#fig215">215</a>, <a href="#fig216">216</a>). The prothallium is still more
reduced in <i>Isoëtes</i> and <i>Selaginella</i>; <i>partly</i> because
it is smaller and is in a higher degree enclosed in the spore, it also
contains less chlorophyll, or is entirely without chlorophyll, and
in consequence incapable of independent existence, whilst the number
of archegonia is less; and <i>partly</i> because the archegonia are
themselves reduced, the cells of the neck are fewer and embedded to
the level of the surface of the prothallium without any, or with only
a very slight projection (Figs. <a href="#fig235">235</a>, <a href="#fig236">236</a>).&mdash;Finally, the prothallium
with its archegonia begins to develope in <i>Selaginella</i> while the
macrospore is still within its sporangium, and before it is set free
from the mother-plant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> After the spores are set free and germination
has commenced, the spore-wall ruptures and the prothallium is exposed.</p>

should be compared with this (see pages <a href="#Page_181">181</a>, <a href="#Page_208">208</a>, <a href="#Page_216">216</a>).</p>
  </div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">GYMNOSPERMS</span> go still further. The macrospore (embryo-sac)
germinates and forms internally a cellular tissue, designated in
former times by the name of <i>albumen</i> (endosperm), which is
<i>homologous with the prothallium</i>. It always <i>remains enclosed
in the embryo-sac</i>, and is a parenchymatous mass containing a large
supply of nourishment. In the upper part of the endosperm a number of
archegonia are developed which are in the main constructed in the same
manner as those in the Cryptogams, but are still more reduced, the
neck consisting only of 4, 2, or 1 cell (Figs. <a href="#fig251">251</a>, <a href="#fig252">252</a>). The ventral
canal-cell is also formed, in the majority, as a small portion cut off
from the large central cell just beneath the neck; the larger remaining
portion becomes the oosphere. When the pollen-tube has passed down
to the oosphere (Fig. <a href="#fig253">253</a>) and fertilisation has been effected, the
oospore commences a cell-formation, the final result of which is the
formation of <i>an embryo</i> (<i>the asexual generation</i>) which is
provided with a thinner, lower end, termed the suspensor. The embryo
is forced more or less into the endosperm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> in which it may rest for a
longer or shorter time, and generally is developed to such an extent
that it has a distinct primary-root (radicle) and stem (plumule) with
one or more embryo-leaves (cotyledons).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the oosphere has been fertilised its nucleus sinks down
to its lower end, and by repeated division into two, forms
four cells lying in one plane (Fig. <a href="#fig253">253</a>, see base of the left
archegonium). Three tiers of cells are now formed by transverse
division of these four. It is the intermediate one of these
which elongates and forms the suspensor, or four suspensors, if
they separate from each other, which push the lowermost four
cells deep down into the endosperm. It is from these four lower
cells that the embryo (or four embryos when the suspensors
separate) is developed, but never more than one embryo attains
full development. As several archegonia are contained in one and
the same ovule, all of which are capable of forming embryos,
there is the possibility that several embryos may be developed
in a seed (polyembryony), but usually only one embryo attains
perfect development.</p>

<p>At the same time that the embryo is being developed, other changes are
taking place in the ovule, especially in the integument which becomes
the shell of the seed (<i>testa</i>). The endosperm grows, and the
embryo-sac supplants the cells of the nucellus. The <i>seed</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> is now
formed, and it consists in its most complete development, as in this

  </div>

<p>The reduction in the <span class="smcap">Angiosperms</span> is carried to the extreme
limit. In the embryo-sac (the macrospore) the nucleus by continued
division produces a prothallium consisting of primordial cells (Fig.
<a href="#fig254">254</a>). In the upper end of the embryo-sac (which is nearest the
micropyle) are three cells, two of which are termed the “co-operating
cells” (<i>synergidæ</i>) and the third is the <i>oosphere</i>.
Three others are placed at the opposite end of the embryo-sac and
are therefore termed the “antipodal cells.” Finally, a large cell
is also formed, which occupies the space between the two groups and
whose cell-nucleus, the central definitive nucleus, lies in the centre
of the embryo-sac. These primordial cells are the slight remnant of
the prothallium. The entire structure of the archegonium, with its
neck and canal-cells, has disappeared, and nothing is left but the
indispensable <i>oosphere</i>. When the oosphere has been fertilised,
and has commenced the cellular divisions which lead to the formation of
the embryo (Fig. <a href="#fig255">255</a>), the synergidæ and antipodal cells are absorbed,
and a cell-formation begins by a new process which emanates from the
definitive nucleus and by which a parenchymatous cell-tissue, the
nutritive-tissue, arises which may perhaps be considered as homologous
with the endosperm of the Gymnosperms. The difference is that the
nutritive-tissue of the Angiosperms is formed in two parts with an
intervening interruption; the primary nutritive-tissue is first formed,
and after fertilisation is absorbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> with the exception of one cell,
which continues the development and gives rise to the nutritive-tissue
proper, which is formed in the first instance of primordial cells,
and later on of a cellular tissue; this nutritive-tissue formed in
the embryo-sac is termed “endosperm”; in a few instances<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a tissue
which is derived from the nucellus functions as nutritive-tissue, and
is termed “perisperm.” In many plants the seeds, when ripe, contain a
very rich nutritive-tissue, in addition to the embryo, for the purpose
of its nourishment during germination. These are termed albuminous
(endospermous) seeds, in distinction to the ex-albuminous, or those in
which the nutritive-tissue is stored in the embryo itself, before it is
completely developed, and used for its sustenance.</p>

<p>In addition to the changes which fertilisation produces in the ovule
itself, it also gives the impetus to a series of changes in the
entire shoot which bears the ovule. The perianth, stamens, and style,
generally wither, because the part they play is at an end; the wall
of the ovary grows and becomes the wall of the fruit (pericarp).
The entire gynœcium of a flower, transformed as a consequence of
fertilisation, is termed a <i>fruit</i>. It consists of two parts, the
<i>pericarp</i> and the <i>seeds</i>, and according to the nature of
the pericarp, the fruit is termed a capsule, nut, berry, or drupe.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of the Phanerogams does not lie in the
formation of the flower (although they may quite properly be termed
“Flowering-plants”), because Equisetums and Lycopods have reproductive
shoots as highly differentiated as those of certain Gymnosperms and
other Phanerogams. As regards the <span class="allsmcap">SEXUAL GENERATION</span> the
characteristics are found:&mdash;(1) in its great reduction; (2) in the
transmission of the microspore (pollen-grain) to the macrosporangium,
and its germination, with the formation of a <i>pollen-tube</i>
(antheridium), the protoplasm of which is not differentiated into
spermatozoids; (3) in the fact that the macrospore (embryo-sac) never
leaves its sporangium (nucellus); and further in the Angiosperms, (4)
in the peculiar development of the nutritive-tissue in two parts; and
(5) in the great reduction of the archegonium.</p>

<p>As regards the <span class="allsmcap">ASEXUAL GENERATION</span> the characteristic feature
is that this generation is formed whilst the sporangium is still
attached to the mother-plant, and for a long time is nourished by
it; and that after the sporangium has become detached from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
mother-plant, it spends a longer or shorter resting period as the
embryo in the seed (enveloped by the testa), and does not make its
appearance until the “germination” of the seed. In addition the shoot
which bears sporangia undergoes greater modification than in the case
of the Flowerless-plants.</p>

<p>The Phanerogams are separated into two Divisions as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Division 4. <b>Gymnospermæ.</b> The ovules, as well as the seeds,
are borne <i>naked</i> on the surface of <i>open carpels</i>, or on
the apex of a stem (ovary wanting). The pollen-grains are conveyed
by the wind to the ovules, and caught by drops of mucilage, secreted
by the micropyle. A “stigma” is <i>wanting</i>. The entire <i>female
prothallium</i> (<i>the endosperm</i>), which serves for the
nourishment of the embryo, is <i>formed before fertilisation</i>. The
archegonia are <i>embedded in the upper part of the prothallium. The
pollen-grains are “multicellular,” i.e.</i> there is always in their
interior a distinct prothallium, formed by 1–3 cells, and a larger cell
which gives rise to the pollen-tube.</p>

<p>Division 5. <b>Angiospermæ.</b> The carpels surround the ovules and
form an entirely closed chamber (<i>ovary</i>), in which the ovules
mature and ripen into seeds. The surface of a portion of the apex of
the carpel is transformed into the “stigma,” which, by a sticky fluid
and also by hair-structures, is capable of retaining the pollen-grains
conveyed to it by the wind, or more frequently by insects. The
pollen-tube grows from the stigma, through the “conducting cellular
tissue” (<i>style</i>), to the ovules. The pollen-grains contain two
cells, a vegetative and a free generative cell. The latter passes
into the pollen-tube and there divides into two, one of which is the
sperm-nucleus. The female prothallium, which is intended to serve as
nutritive-tissue, is formed <i>after fertilisation</i>. Archegonia are
wanting.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">DIVISION IV.<br />
<span class="subhed">GYMNOSPERMÆ.</span></h2></div>

<p>The following characters should be added to those already given on page
<a href="#Page_2">2</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Gymnosperms comprise only trees or shrubs. The flowers are always
<i>unisexual</i> and destitute of perianth (except <i>Gnetaceæ</i>);
the female plant of <i>Cycas</i> is the only one which has no flower.
The <span class="allsmcap">MALE FLOWERS</span> are constructed on the same type as the
cones of the Horsetails and Club-Mosses, and are <i>most frequently
long shoots</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig243">243</a>, <a href="#fig258">258</a>, <a href="#fig260">260</a> <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig267">267</a> <i>J</i>) bearing a
number of spiral or verticillate stamens. The <span class="allsmcap">FEMALE FLOWERS</span>
are of a more varied structure (see the orders). The <span class="allsmcap">OVULE</span>
<i>is orthotropous</i> (except <i>Podocarpus</i> which is anatropous)
and projects from the carpel uprightly, inverted, or horizontally;
it has usually <i>only one integument</i> (compare however Taxaceæ)
which proceeds from the upper part of the nucellus, so that the
embryo-sac in part is placed below the integuments (Figs. <a href="#fig251">251</a>, <a href="#fig264">264</a>).
The drop of mucilage which catches the pollen-grains dries up and
draws the pollen-grain through the micropyle to a space just above the
nucellus&mdash;<i>the pollen-chamber</i>&mdash;in which the germination of the
pollen-grain commences.</p>

<p>In each seed, only one of the many embryos which are formed proceeds
to its full development. The seed is always <i>endospermous</i>, and
the embryo has one, two, or a whorl of several cotyledons. A vigorous
primary root is developed on germination. <span class="smcap">The vascular bundles</span>
in the stem are arranged in a ring, and <i>increase in thickness</i>
takes place by a closed cambium-ring which forms bast (<i>phlœem</i>)
externally, and wood (<i>xylem</i>) internally with distinct annual
rings, <i>as in the Dicotyledons</i>. Only certain of the Cycadeæ
deviate from this arrangement. The <i>secondary wood</i> is very
uniform, as it is almost exclusively <i>formed of tracheides</i> with
bordered pits, but <i>true vessels are wanting</i>; this also indicates
a relationship with the Pteridophyta (see page <a href="#Page_202">202</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p>The Gymnosperms are biologically lower than the Angiosperms; they are
wind-fertilised, and without extra floral-nectaries.</p>

<p>This Division embraces three classes: <span class="smcap">Cycadeæ</span>,
<span class="smcap">Coniferæ</span>, And <span class="smcap">Gneteæ</span>. It is no doubt monophyletic,
and has taken its origin from heterosporous Ferns, now extinct, most
nearly related to the Ophioglossaceæ and Marattiaceæ. The Cycadeæ
appear to be the oldest class. The Coniferæ are related to these
through Ginkgo. The Gnetaceæ are more isolated. The Division is not
continued into the higher Flowering-plants; it has evidently attained
its highest development, and is now in a retrograde condition. The
similarity which has often been pointed out between certain Coniferæ
and Lycopodinæ is only in analogous resemblances, and does not entitle
one to suppose that there is a nearer relationship, or that the former
take their origin from the latter.</p>


<h3>Class 1. <b>Cycadeæ.</b></h3>

<p>The stem is very <i>rarely ramified</i>. The leaves are <i>large</i>,
<i>pinnate</i>, and arranged spirally. The flowers are <i>diœcious,
without perianth</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig256" style="width: 750px">

     <p class="p0 sm"><span class="smcap">Fig. 256.</span>&mdash;<i>Cycas circinalis</i> (female
plant). The carpels are seen hanging from the top of the stem. Three
leaves with the leaflets still rolled up project almost vertically into
the air, from the centre of the crown.</p>
  </div>

<p>There is only one order, the <b>Cycadaceæ</b>.&mdash;In habit they resemble
the Ferns, especially the Tree-Ferns (compare Figs. <a href="#fig207">207</a> and <a href="#fig256">256</a>). The
stem is tubercular (Fig. <a href="#fig258">258</a>), or cylindrical (Fig. <a href="#fig256">256</a>), but not
very tall (as much as about 12 metres), and very rarely ramified. [In
Ceylon, unbranched specimens of <i>Cycas</i> are rarely met with in the
wild state. The stems of <i>C. circinalis</i> occasionally branch in
greenhouses.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">LEAVES</span> are arranged spirally, and so closely together
that no free stem-surface is left between them, and have only a slight
sheath (which is not amplexicaul, as in the Palms). They are compound
(most frequently pinnate; in <i>Bowenia</i>, bipinnate); in some genera
the leaves are rolled up in various ways, resembling the vernation in
Ferns (Fig. <a href="#fig257">257</a>); they are leathery and perennial. In some, stipules
are present, as in the Marattiaceæ. Groups of scale-leaves alternate in
the majority with groups of foliage-leaves.</p>

integrifolia</i> (½-⅓ nat. size). The male cone is very similar
externally.</p>
  </div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">FLOWERS</span> are without perianth. The <span class="allsmcap">MALE FLOWER</span> is
sometimes an enormous collection of stamens (Fig. <a href="#fig258">258</a>), which are flat
in some (<i>Cycas</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig241">241</a>), shield-like in others (<i>Zamia</i>,
<i>Ceratozamia</i>) like the sporophylls in Horsetail (Fig. <a href="#fig259">259</a>); but
in all, the pollen-sacs are situated in large and varying numbers
on the back of the stamens, and arranged in groups of 2–5, like the
sporangia in the sori of the Ferns (Fig. <a href="#fig241">241</a> <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>).
<span class="smcap">Female flowers</span> <i>are wanting</i> in <i>Cycas</i>, because the
carpels do not terminate the apical growth of the stem. After a group
of foliage-and of scale-leaves, a group of carpels is developed, which
are pinnate and resemble the foliage-leaves, bearing on their edges
a number of ovules (most frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> 5–6) (Figs. <a href="#fig245">245</a>, <a href="#fig256">256</a>); the same
stem produces successively scale-leaves, foliage-leaves, and carpels.
The differentiation is not much more advanced than in certain Ferns
(<i>Struthiopteris</i>, <i>Blechnum</i>), where barren and fertile
leaves of different form regularly alternate. <i>The other genera have
female flowers</i>; the carpels are shield-like in <i>Zamia</i> and
<i>Ceratozamia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig246">246</a>), and collected into cone-like flowers,
which terminate the growth of the stem (Fig. <a href="#fig259">259</a>). The number of ovules
in these instances is two to each carpel.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SEEDS</span> are large (most frequently 2–6 centimetres long)
and plum-like; the external layer of the testa is fleshy, while the
internal one is hard and horny. There are two systems of vascular
bundles in the testa, one outside, the other inside the stone. The
embryo is straight, attached to the end of the suspensor, which is
often long, filamentous, and rolled up; it has one or two cotyledons.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The embryo in <i>Ceratozamia</i> and others is very slightly
developed, at the time when the ripe seed is detached from
the carpel; and it is not until after sowing that its further
development and germination proceed. This calls to mind the
Cryptogams, especially <i>Selaginella</i>, whose macrospores
are thrown off filled with endosperm; but the oosphere is not
fertilised till after the separation of the macrospore from the
parent-plant, while in the Cycadeæ fertilisation is effected
before the separation. In <i>Cycas</i> the testa may rupture,
and the endosperm grow and become green in the light, even
though no embryo has been formed. This also is an indication of
its prothalloid nature.</p>

<p>Gum-passages are present in all organs. Collateral vascular
bundles, with spiral and scalariform tracheides, are found;
and normal thickening takes place by means of a cambium.
An exceptional mode of growth is found in <i>Cycas</i> and
<i>Encephalartos</i>, the cambium ceases to divide after a time
and is replaced by a new cambium which arises in the cortical
parenchyma just outside the bast, and which forms a new ring
of xylem and phlœem. This may be repeated so that a number of
concentric rings are produced. In <i>Ceratozamia</i>, structures
resembling corals extend from the roots in a vertical direction
and appear on the surface of the soil; these are peculiar roots,
in which a symbiotic Alga (<i>Anabæna</i>) is found.</p>

<p>The Cycadeæ were formerly (from the Coal period to the Later
Cretaceous) far more numerous than at the present day. They
appear to have been most numerous in the Trias and Jurassic.
The remnant (75 species) which have persisted to the present
time are found in all tropical countries. <i>Cycas</i> (Trop.
and Sub-trop., Eastern Hemisphere); <i>Dioon</i> (Mexico);
<i>Macrozamia</i> (Australia); <i>Encephalartos</i> (Trop. and
S. Africa); <i>Stangeria</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig258">258</a>, Sub-trop. South and East
Africa); <i>Bowenia</i> (Trop. Australia); <i>Ceratozamia</i>
(Mexico, New Granada, Western Brazil); <i>Microcycas</i> (Cuba);
<i>Zamia</i> (Trop. and Sub-trop. N. America.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Sago is made from the starch-containing pith of
<i>Cycas revoluta</i> and <i>circinalis</i>. The leaves are
often used at funerals and church festivals, under the name of
“palm-branches.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>


<h3>Class 2. <b>Coniferæ</b> (<b>Pine-trees</b>).</h3>

<p>The stem <i>branches freely</i>. The leaves are <i>entire</i>,
relatively small, linear or reduced to scales. The flowers are without
perianth. The ovules naked. It is seldom that the female flower is
reduced to only one carpel.</p>

<p>Whilst the Cycadeæ principally resemble the Ferns, the Conifers
partly resemble the Lycopods, and partly the Equisetums&mdash;the former
especially in the <i>needle- or scale-like</i>, leathery, simple, and
often perennial leaves (“evergreen plants”), which <i>never possess
stipules</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig263">263</a>, <a href="#fig270">270</a>, <a href="#fig272">272</a>). <i>Ginkgo</i> deviates from this,
being no doubt the oldest, and the Conifer which stands nearest to the
Cycadeæ (Fig. <a href="#fig260">260</a>). The resemblance to the Equisetums is especially
owing to the fact that the stem ramifies abundantly, and often very
regularly, forming a pyramid with verticillate branches. In addition
to the foliage-leaves, scale-leaves (bud-scales) are present in the
majority of species.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">FLOWERS</span> are monœcious or more rarely diœcious. <i>Perianth
is wanting.</i> The stamens of the <i>catkin-like male flowers</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>, <i>J</i>) are of different forms, but as a rule more or
less shield-like. As in the Cycadeæ, the pollen-sacs are in all cases
situated <i>on the underside</i>. There are, as a rule, two pollen-sacs
(the Abietaceæ, Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>), or 3–5, (the Cupressaceæ and Taxaceæ, Fig.
<a href="#fig243">243</a>); a few have more, <i>e.g. Araucaria</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig242">242</a>); they
dehisce by clefts.</p>

<p>If, in commencing our consideration of the <i>female flower</i>, we
begin with that of <i>Ginkgo</i>, we shall observe in the corner of a
scale- or foliage-leaf a small flower, which consists of two carpels,
each bearing one ovule, and reduced almost to the ovule itself (Fig.
<a href="#fig260">260</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>). The flower in <i>Podocarpus</i> is still
further reduced, viz. to a single carpel with one ovule, which is
anatropous and has two integuments. This ovule is situated in the
axil of a cover-scale (<i>c</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig262">262</a> <i>D</i>), and several
female flowers of this description are collected in a small cone,
the stalk and bracts of which become fleshy (Fig. <a href="#fig262">262</a> <i>C</i>). The
external integument also becomes fleshy (an aril). <i>Dacrydium</i>,
which is clearly related to <i>Podocarpus</i>, has an external
integument which developes more independently as a fleshy aril (Fig.
<a href="#fig262">262</a> <i>B</i>, <i>B’</i>). <i>Microcachrys</i> also is clearly allied
to these: the bracts are more fleshy, and the ovule (<i>i.e.</i> the
female flower) is protruded beyond the bract (Fig. <a href="#fig262">262</a> <i>A</i>,
<i>A’</i>). <i>Taxus</i> stands in a more isolated position: a flower
which has been reduced to an ovule is situated, in this instance, on
the apex of a secondary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> branch which is studded with floral-leaves
(Figs. <a href="#fig263">263</a>, <a href="#fig264">264</a>); an external integument is developed on all sides and
surrounds the seed as a scarlet aril. According to this conception
<i>the aril corresponds to an external integument</i>, and the Taxoideæ
thus possess a partly dichlamydeous ovule. Only <i>Ginkgo</i> and
<i>Cephalotaxus</i> appear to deviate from this, as in these there is
only one integument (unless the small outgrowth indicated by <i>ar</i>,
in Fig. <a href="#fig260">260</a> <i>D</i>, really is a rudimentary, external integument);
in <span class="smcap">Cycadeæ</span>, to which <i>Ginkgo</i> is most closely related,
there is likewise only one integument. But in these genera the testa is
differentiated into two layers, and the seed resembles a drupe; like
the Cycadeæ there is an external fleshy covering and an internal hard
one, and these two layers may probably be considered homologous with
the two integuments. This theory is also borne out by the arrangement
of the vascular bundles in <i>Cephalotaxus</i> and <i>Podocarpus</i>,
which present the xylem in the fleshy external layer to the
<i>outside</i> of the testa, which is therefore the upper side of the
integument (Celakovsky).</p>

<p>The coalescence of the integuments into one is only slight in
<i>Torreya</i>, more pronounced in <i>Podocarpus</i> and strongest in
<i>Cephalotaxus</i> and <i>Ginkgo</i>. Celakovsky terms these ovules
“holochlamydeous.”</p>

<p>If we pass from these to the order <span class="smcap">Pinoideæ</span>, we find the
female flowers collected into catkin-like cones, which have been
considered from various points of view to be sometimes single
flowers, at other times compound inflorescences. The structure in
<span class="smcap">Abietaceæ</span> is as follows: a number of spirally arranged,
scale-like leaves, <i>cover-scales</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig267">267</a>, <a href="#fig268">268</a>), are situated
on a long axis. In the axil of each cover-scale a larger leaf-like
projection, <i>the ovuliferous scale</i>, is borne, which turns the
upper side towards its cover-scale (which is shown by the fact that
the wood of its vascular bundles is turned downwards and towards
the wood in the bundles of the cover-scale: Fig. <a href="#fig269">269</a>). Two ovules,
with micropyles turned towards the central axis, and with apparently
only one integument (Fig. <a href="#fig268">268</a>), are situated on the dorsal side of
each ovuliferous scale, <i>i.e.</i> the side turned away from the
cover-scale. The ovuliferous scales grow after fertilisation, into the
woody or leathery “cone-scales,” which are usually much larger than
the cover-scales. This ovuliferous scale with its axis may, according
to Celakovsky, be considered as a dwarf-branch which is situated in
the axil of the cover-scale, and bears two ovules (in the same way as
in <i>Ginkgo</i>, one long-stalked flower, reduced to two ovules, is
situated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> in the axil of a leaf), and <i>in this case the external
integument of the ovules</i> is expanded into leaf-like bodies,
which have united to form one “<i>symphyllodium</i>” (<i>ovuliferous
scale</i>) which is inverted so that its dorsal side is turned upwards
and bears the nucellus and the other integument (“hemichlamydeous”
ovules). The carpel itself is therefore in this instance extremely
reduced. The keel, or (in <i>Pinus</i>) “mucro” (Fig. <a href="#fig268">268</a> <i>B</i>),
which is found in several genera, represents then a third carpel,
which is sterile. In the other orders of the Pinoideæ the cover-scales
and ovuliferous scales grow more and more together and finally form
one structure, which also is termed a “cone-scale,” although from
its development it cannot be homologous with the cone-scales of the
Abietaceæ. This connation is least in the <span class="smcap">Taxodiaceæ</span> and
<span class="smcap">Araucariaceæ</span> and may be traced on the upper surface of
the “cone-scale” by the presence of a stronger or slighter ridge
or pad, the free portion of the ovuliferous scale (Figs. <a href="#fig256">256</a>, <a href="#fig265_266">266</a>,
<a href="#fig269">269</a>). It is most strongly pronounced in the <span class="smcap">Cupressaceæ</span>, in
which the two scales form one single structure, the cone-scale (Fig.
<a href="#fig274">274</a>). The vascular bundles in the under portion corresponding to the
cover-scale, have the xylem towards the upper side as usual in leaves,
whilst the bundles present in the upper side of the cone-scale, which
thus represents the ovuliferous scale, turn their xylem downwards.
The hemichlamydeous ovules are then situated on the upper side of
this cone-scale. According to this theory the <span class="smcap">Cupressaceæ</span>
appear to be the youngest type, a view which corresponds with their
vegetative structure. If there is only one ovule in these orders as
in <i>Agathis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig265_266">265</a>) and <i>Araucaria</i>, then the flower
is reduced to a single carpel and one ovule, as in the case of
<i>Dacrydium</i> and <i>Microcachrys</i>. If two or more ovules are
present, then the same number of carpels may be supposed to exist, the
external integuments of their ovules being developed into leaf-like
structures which collaterally coalesce to form a “symphyllodium,” or
are suppressed.</p>

<p>According to this theory, which is based on the researches of
Celakovsky, the female flowers of the Coniferæ may be classed thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In all cases situated in the axil of a bract and collected
into cones, with numerous flowers or with few or one flower. In
<i>Ginkgo</i> only, are they situated in the axil of foliage- or
scale-leaves.</p>

<p>2. It is only in <i>Taxus</i> that bracteoles are present.</p>

<p>3. They are formed only from rudimentary carpels, in which the stem
takes no part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p>4. The number of carpels in each flower varies from one to many, most
frequently three, of which the central one remains sterile.</p>

<p>5. Each carpel bears only one ovule. The flower which is formed of only
one carpel appears to consist of only one ovule.</p>

<p>6. The ovule has in Taxaceæ either a double integument (Podocarpeæ,
Taxeæ), of which the external is the “aril,” or, as in the Cycadeæ, a
single one, which is homologous with the two united together.</p>

<p>7. The external integument in the Pinoideæ is expanded to form a
leaf-like structure&mdash;the ovuliferous scale&mdash;and bears on its dorsal
side the ovules, which are thus only provided with one, and that the
inner, integument.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This later interpretation of the female cones in the Coniferæ is
more probably correct than the older ones; that, however, which
appeared in the former issues of this book, may also be stated.
It was to the effect that each catkin-like female cone is in
reality a single flower; the cone-scales in the Cupressaceæ
were single leaves, namely carpels, which bore the ovules on
the side which is turned upwards; the division into two parts
which makes its appearance in the other orders, and becomes
most prominent in the Abietaceæ, was compared with the division
of a leaf into a barren and a fertile portion, which is found
especially in Ophioglossaceæ and Marsiliaceæ, or with the ligule
in <i>Isoëtes</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination</span> is accomplished by means of the wind. At the
period of pollination the leaves are always so widely separated from
one another, that the ovules can catch the pollen-grains carried to
them by the wind; this is often effected by the mucilaginous drops
which appear at the micropyle, and by the evaporation of which the
pollen-grains are brought in contact with the nucellus. The entire cone
grows considerably as soon as fertilisation has taken place, and the
cone-scales in Pinoideæ close together so that the seeds while maturing
are enclosed, and it is not until the seeds are ready for distribution
that the cone-scales again become separated. In the Pinoideæ, the fully
developed ovuliferous scales are hard and woody; and in this condition
the collection of female flowers is termed a <i>cone</i>. In the
Taxoideæ, true cones are the exception. 2–15 cotyledons are present,
arranged in a whorl.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of this class is the abundance of
<i>resin</i>, which is to be found in isolated cells (especially in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> cortex), partly in intercellular glands or passages (both in the
cortex and wood). <i>Taxus</i> is the only genus which has no resin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are about 350 species, mostly from the Northern Temperate
zone (especially North America and Siberia), where they grow
gregariously and form the most northern forests. The Juniper,
Scotch Fir, and Yew are natives of Great Britain.</p>
</div>

<p>This class may be divided into two families:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <b>Taxoideæ.</b> The ovules have either one integument, the external
part of which is fleshy, and the internal hard and stone-like; or two
integuments, of which the external is the fleshy and coloured “aril.”
“Ovuliferous scales” are wanting. The cones are never woody, but are
generally succulent, the bracts become fleshy, or cones usually are not
developed. The seeds project more or less freely beyond the bracts.</p>

<p>2. <b>Pinoideæ.</b> The ovules have two integuments, the external one
of which is leaf-like and becomes developed as the “ovuliferous scale”;
if there are several of these in each flower they unite and form a
“symphyllodium.” This may remain free or unite with the bract. The
cones are most frequently woody, rarely succulent. The seeds are hidden
among the cone-scales.</p>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Taxoideæ.</b></h4>

<p>This family, considered to be most nearly related to the Cycadeæ, also
made its appearance at a very early period. There is only one order.</p>

<p>Order. <b>Taxaceæ.</b> The characters have been given above.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> <span class="smcap">Cephalotaxeæ</span> is the oldest group, presumably the
connecting link between the Cycadeæ and the other Coniferæ. The flower
consists normally of two ovules. Aril wanting. One integument. Seeds
drupaceous.&mdash;The flowers in <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> (<i>Salisburia</i>)
are situated in the axil of foliage- or scale-leaves. The stamens
bear only two pollen-sacs (Fig. <a href="#fig260">260</a> <i>A</i>). The female flower
has two ovules, placed together at the end of a long, bare axis
(Fig. <a href="#fig260">260</a> <i>C</i>). Round the base of the ovule a small collar
(<i>ar</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig260">260</a> <i>D</i>) is found, which may probably be
considered homologous with the collar-like outgrowth which surrounds
the base of the <i>Cycas</i>-ovule. The seed resembles a Plum, and
has a fleshy external coat, surrounding a hard internal layer. The
embryo is developed after the seed has fallen off. The Ginkgo-tree
has long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, more or less indented, with
dichotomous veins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> resembling certain Ferns&mdash;the Adiantums. It is a
native of East Asia, and the only surviving species of a genus which in
earlier times was very rich in species, and distributed over the entire
Northern Hemisphere. <i>Cephalotaxus</i> (Eastern Asia) is related to
it.</p>

ovule, placed in the axil of a bract, or a little forward upon it.
The ovule has an aril (2 integuments).&mdash;<i>Phyllocladus</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig261">261</a>), from New Zealand and Tasmania, has obtained its name from its
flat, <i>leaf-like branches</i>, the leaves proper being scale-like
(<i>f</i>). The ovules stand <i>erect</i> in the axil of the scale-like
leaves (<i>c</i>), and several are collected at the end of short
branches.&mdash;<i>Microcachrys tetragona</i> (Tasmania) has a small
female catkin with several spirally-placed, fleshy bracts, at the end
of which the inward and downward turned ovule is attached (Fig. <a href="#fig262">262</a>
<i>A</i>, <i>A’</i>). The ripe cones are red, succulent, and resemble
Strawberries.&mdash;In <i>Dacrydium</i> (Tasmania, New Zealand, Malaysia)
the female cone has most frequently only 1–2 (–6) bracts, which
resemble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> the vegetative leaves; they have also a fleshy aril (Fig.
<a href="#fig262">262</a> <i>B</i>, <i>B’</i>).&mdash;<i>Podocarpus</i> (40 species, East Asia,
S. Temp.); the bracts of the female flowers become fleshy, and unite
together; only 1 or 2 are of use in supporting the flowers. The ovules
project high above the apex of the bract, and are <i>anatropous</i>,
the micropyle being turned downwards (Fig. <a href="#fig262">262</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>).
An aril commences to develope in the flowering period as an external
coating, and later on it becomes fleshy and coloured.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <span class="smcap">Taxeæ.</span> The female flower is reduced to one ovule,
which is situated <i>terminally</i> on an axis which bears 2–3 pairs of
opposite, scale-like bracteoles; on this account the Taxeæ form a very
isolated group among the Coniferæ.&mdash;<i>Taxus</i> (<i>T. baccata</i>,
the Yew-tree). <i>Diœcious</i>. <i>The female flower consists of
only one ovule</i>, placed <i>at the end</i> of a short secondary
branch (Fig. <a href="#fig264">264</a>), which is studded with scale-like leaves. The aril
when ripe is thick, fleshy, and scarlet (sometimes yellow), and only
loosely envelopes the seed (Fig. <a href="#fig263">263</a>). The leaves are scattered, flat,
linear, and pointed (Fig. <a href="#fig263">263</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> <a href="#fig264">264</a>). The short male flowers have 5–8
pollen-sacs, pendent from the stamens, and are surrounded at their
bases by scale-like bracteoles (Fig. <a href="#fig243">243</a>). <i>Torreya</i> (4 species,
N. America and Japan) is closely allied to <i>Taxus</i>. The aril
ultimately fuses with the woody inner integument, and hence the ovule
becomes drupaceous, as in Cephalotaxaceæ.</p>

</div>


<h4>Family 2. <b>Pinoideæ.</b></h4>

<p>The four orders differ from one another partly in the arrangement of
the leaves (<i>Cupressaceæ</i> have opposite or verticillately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> placed
leaves, flowers, and inflorescences; in the others they are placed
spirally), but chiefly in the greater or less degree of union which
takes place between the female flower (the leaf-like “symphyllodium”)
and its supporting cover-scale, and in the position of the ovules (the
micropyle being turned upwards or downwards). The “cone-scales” in
<i>Abietaceæ</i> are formed by “symphyllodia” alone, in the others by
their union with the cover-scale.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Araucariaceæ.</b> This order most frequently has
<i>solitary</i> ovules, <i>turned downwards</i> and attached <i>to the
centre</i> of the cone-scales. In <i>Agathis</i> (<i>Dammara</i>) the
arrangement is the most simple, a winged seed (Fig. <a href="#fig265_266">265</a>), which hangs
<i>freely</i> downwards, being borne in the centre of the undivided
cone-scale. In <i>Araucaria</i>, the stamens with the <i>free,
pendulous</i> pollen-sacs have been represented in Fig. <a href="#fig242">242</a>; the
ovuliferous scale is united for nearly its whole length with the bract,
and projects from its apex in the shape of a sheath-like, dentate
scale, resembling the ligule in <i>Isoëtes</i>, and may therefore be
termed a “ligule.” <i>Araucaria</i> (S. America, Australia) has often
rather broad leaves (<i>A. brasiliensis</i>). The ovuliferous scale
in <i>Cunninghamia</i> is more distinct, and stretches transversely
over the entire cover-scale; it bears three inverted ovules (Fig. <a href="#fig265_266">266</a>)
(Eastern Asia).</p>

</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Abietaceæ (Pine and Fir Trees).</b> The leaves are spirally
arranged and needle-like. The flowers are <i>monœcious</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> The male
flowers are long, and catkin-like, with numerous stamens, each bearing
two <i>oblong pollen-sacs</i>. The pollen-grains are most frequently
tri-lobed, having two bladder-like appendages, formed as outgrowths of
the exospore, to assist in their distribution by the wind (Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>
<i>N</i>). The bracts are arranged spirally. The union between the
bract and the ovuliferous scale, which is found in the preceding order,
is not in this instance so complete; these scales make their appearance
as two free parts, and are attached only at their bases (Fig. <a href="#fig268">268</a>);
the lower portion, that is the cover-scale, in most instances remains
quite small (Fir, Red Pine, and others), it is only in the “Noble
Pine” (<i>Abies</i>) and <i>Pseudotsuga douglasii</i>, that it attains
a greater length than the ovuliferous scale (Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>, <i>B-G</i>).
On the other hand the upper part, <i>the ovuliferous scale</i> (the
vascular bundles of which have the bast turned upwards), grows strongly
and elongates, especially after fertilisation, becoming woody or
leathery; it is commonly termed the “<i>cone-scale</i>,” but is in
reality only homologous with a part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> the “cone-scale” in the other
order of Pinoideæ. On the side of the ovuliferous scale, turned towards
the axis, are situated <i>two ovules</i> with micropyles <i>directed
inwards</i>. The seeds are most frequently provided with <i>a false
wing</i> (a tissue-like part of the surface of the ovuliferous scale).
Cotyledons, <i>more than</i> 2, <i>verticillate</i>. <i>Fertilisation
does not take place until some time after pollination.</i> In
<i>Pinus</i>, for instance, the pollen-tube only penetrates the
nucellus for a short distance during the year of pollination, and then
ceases its further growth, fertilisation not taking place until after
the middle of the next year; whilst the seeds ripen about a year and a
half after pollination. In the Larch and others, the seeds are mature
in the autumn succeeding pollination.</p>

<p><i>Abies</i> (Fir). The leaves are often (<i>e.g. Ab.
pectinata</i>) displaced into 2 rows, flat and indented at the
apex, with 2 white (wax-covered) lines on the under surface, in
which the stomata are situated. The leaf-scars are nearly circular
and do not project. The cones are erect. <i>The cover-scales and
the ovuliferous scales separate from the axis</i>, to which they
remain attached in other genera.&mdash;<span class="smaller"><i>Tsuga</i>
has leaves like <i>Abies</i>, but by the slightly projecting
leaf-scars, and cones with persistent scales, it forms the transition
to <i>Picea</i>.&mdash;<i>Pseudotsuga</i> has leaves similar to those
of <i>Abies</i> and persistent carpels as in <i>Picea</i>, but the
cover-scales grow as in <i>Abies</i> and project beyond the ovuliferous
scales (<i>P. douglasii</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>). These two genera are considered
as sub-genera of <i>Abies</i>.</span>&mdash;<i>Picea</i>. The leaves project
on all sides, square and pointed; the leaf-scars are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> rhombic, on
projecting leaf-cushions. The cones are pendulous. The cover-scales are
much shorter than the leathery, persisting ovuliferous scales.&mdash;The
genus <i>Larix</i> (Larch) differs from all the others in having
deciduous leaves (the three preceding have leaves which persist for
eleven to twelve years). It has <i>long-branches</i> with linear
foliage-leaves and short, thick, <i>perennial dwarf-branches</i>, which
each year form a new rosette of foliage-leaves, similar to those on the
long-branches. The male flowers and the erect cones resemble those of
<i>Picea</i>, and are borne on dwarf-branches.&mdash;<i>Cedrus</i> (Cedar)
resembles <i>Larix</i> to some extent, but has persistent leaves (<i>C.
libani</i>, <i>C. deodara</i>).&mdash;<i>Pinus</i> (Pine) has long-branches
and dwarf-branches. The leaves of the long-branches are scale-like and
not green; the dwarf-branches have very limited growth, and persist
for three years; they arise in the axils of the scales borne on the
long-branches of the self-same year, and each bears 2–5 foliage-leaves,
they are also surrounded at the base by a number of membranous
bud-scales. The cone-scales have a <i>thick, rhomboid extremity</i>
(the “shield”).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The buds which develope into long-branches arise at the apex of
other long-branches, and being very close together, form false
whorls. The female cones occupy the position of long-branches,
and take about two years for their development. The male flowers
arise close together, and form a spike-like inflorescence at
the base of a long-branch of the same year. The male flowers
occupy the position of dwarf-branches, so that a female cone
may be considered to be a modified long-branch, and a male cone
a modified dwarf-branch. The main axis of the seedling has
needle-like leaves, similar to those found on the older parts,
and on dwarf-branches; it is not until some time later that
the dwarf-branches are developed and the permanent arrangement
attained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Several species are commonly cultivated in this
country, partly on heaths and moors, and partly in plantations
and as ornamental trees, such as Mountain Pine (<i>Pinus
montana</i>, Cen. Eur.); Austrian Pine (<i>P. laricio</i>,
Eur.); Scotch Fir (<i>P. silvestris</i>, Eur.); Weymouth
Pine (<i>P. strobus</i>, N. Am.); common Red Pine (<i>Picea
excelsa</i>, Cen. and N. Eur.); White Pine (<i>P. alba</i>, N.
Am.); <i>Abies pectinata</i> (Common Fir, S. and Cen. Eur);
<i>A. nordmanniana</i> (Crimea, Caucasus); <i>A. balsamea</i>
(N. Am.); <i>Tsuga canadensis</i> (N. Am.); <i>Pseudotsuga
douglasii</i> (N.W. Am.); Larch (<i>Larix europæa</i>, Alps,
Carpathians); <i>L. sibirica</i> (N.E. Russia, Siberia).&mdash;The
wood of many species, especially Pine, on account of its
lightness and because it is so easily worked, is very well
adapted for many useful purposes. The wood of the Yew-tree
is very hard and is used for ornamental turning. Resin and
Turpentine (<i>i.e.</i> Resin with essential oils, the name
being derived from the Terebinth-tree, from which formerly a
similar material was obtained) are extracted from <i>Pinus
laricio</i> and <i>P. pinaster</i>. Oil of Turpentine is
obtained by distillation of turpentine with water; Tar by
dry distillation of Pine-wood. Canada-balsam is from North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
American <i>Abies</i>-species (<i>A. balsamea</i> and
<i>Fraseri</i>). The officinal Turpentine is mainly obtained
from <i>Pinus pinaster</i> (South of France), <i>P. tæda</i>,
<i>australis</i>, <i>strobus</i> (Weymouth Pine) and other North
American species; more recently also from <i>P. silvestris</i>
(Scotch Fir), <i>maritima</i>, <i>laricio</i>, <i>Picea
excelsa</i>, and others; Venetian Turpentine, from Larch (S.
Eur.) Amber is resin from a Tertiary plant (<i>Pityoxylon
succiniferum</i>), closely related to the Pine, which grew
especially in the countries round the South-East coast of the
Baltic. <i>Pinus pinea</i> (the Pine, S. Eur.) has edible seeds
and also <i>P. cembra</i> (in Cen. Eur. and Siberia).</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Taxodiaceæ.</b> The vegetative leaves and cone-scales are
arranged spirally. The ovules (2–9) are situated either at the base
of the ovuliferous scales, in which case they are erect; or at their
centre, when they are generally more or less inverted. The ovuliferous
scale is more or less united with the cover-scale, and projects
beyond the surface of the cone-scale, like a comb (Fig. <a href="#fig269">269</a>). The
vascular bundles, which extend into the cover-scale, have the usual
leaf-arrangement, viz. the wood placed above the bast; while those
bundles which enter the ovuliferous scale have this arrangement of the
bundles reversed.</p>

<p><i>Taxodium distichum</i> (the North American “Swamp Cypress”)

the Polar regions. <i>Sequoia (Wellingtonia) gigantea</i>
is the famous Californian Giant-Fir, or Mammoth-Tree, which
attains a height of 300 feet, a diameter of 36 feet, and is
said to live for 1,500 years. <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>
(Japan, China) has the least adnate ovuliferous scales;
<i>Glyptostrobus</i> (China); <i>Arthrotaxis</i> (Tasmania);
<i>Sciadopitys verticillata</i> (the only species in Japan) has,
like <i>Pinus</i>, scale-like leaves on the long-branches, of
which those which are situated at the apex of the annual shoots
support “double needles,” <i>i.e. dwarf-branches</i>
similar to the two-leaved dwarf-branches in <i>Pinus</i>, but
without bud-scales, and with the two leaves fused together at
the edges into one needle, which turns its upper surface away
from the long-branch.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 4. <b>Cupressaceæ</b> (<b>Cypresses</b>). <i>The leaves are
opposite or verticillate</i>, sometimes acicular, but most frequently
scale-like (Fig. <a href="#fig270">270</a>). In the species with scale-like leaves, the
seedlings often commence with acicular leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig272">272</a>), and
branches are sometimes found on the older plants which revert to this
form, seeming to indicate that the acicular leaf was the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
form (atavism). The so-called “<i>Retinospora</i>” species are
seedling-forms of <i>Biota</i>, <i>Thuja</i>, <i>Chamæcyparis</i>,
which have been propagated by cuttings, and retain the seedling-form.
The flowers are monœcious or diœcious. The male flowers are short, and
have shield-like stamens, bearing most frequently several pollen-sacs.
The cover-scales and ovuliferous scales are entirely fused together and
form <i>undivided</i> cone-scales, <i>opposite or whorled</i>; <i>the
ovuliferous scales</i> have slight projections near <i>the base</i> on
which 1–2–several <i>erect ovules</i> are developed (Fig. <a href="#fig274">274</a>). Most

(considerably reduced). The horizontal lines indicate the surface of

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order. <b>Gnetaceæ.</b> The three known genera differ very much
in appearance. <i>Welwitschia mirabilis</i> (from the deserts
of South Western Africa) is the oldest (?) genus now living.
It resembles a giant radish, in that the hypocotyl is the only
part of the main axis of the stem which becomes developed.
It attains a circumference of upwards of four metres with a
length of 1/2½-⅔ of a metre. It bears <i>only</i> two oblong,
leathery leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig275">275</a>) which are torn into segments at the
apex and lie on the surface of the soil; these are the two
first foliage-leaves which succeed the cotyledons, and they are
remarkable for their enormous length (upwards of two metres) as
well as for their long duration, living as long as the plant
itself. In their axils are situated the 4-rowed, spike-like male
and scarlet-coloured female cones, upon dichotomous branches.
The perianth consists in the ♂ of 2 alternating pairs of leaves,
the inner ones of which are slightly united. The andrœcium
likewise consists of 2 whorls: the external (transverse)
with 2, the internal with 4 stamens; the lower halves of
the 6 filaments uniting to form a cup. Each of the terminal
anthers corresponds to a sorus of 3 sporangia, the sporangia
being fused together, and opening at the top by <i>one</i>
three-rayed cleft. In the centre of the ♂-flower there is
a sterile ovule. In the ♀-flower a perianth of two connate
leaves is present.&mdash;<i>Ephedra</i> (desert plants, especially
in the Mediterranean and W. Asia) at first sight resembles an
<i>Equisetum</i>; the stems are thin, long-jointed, and the
leaves opposite, small, and united into a bidentate sheath;
♂-perianth of two connate leaves (median leaves); 2–8 stamens
united into a column. Each anther is formed of 2 sporangia
(is bilocular). ♀ mainly, as in <i>Welwitschia</i>. The seeds
are surrounded by the perianth which finally becomes red and
fleshy. There are 30 species.&mdash;<i>Gnetum</i> has opposite,
lanceolate, pinnately-veined, leathery leaves. They are mostly
climbers (Lianas) from Tropical Asia and America. The ♂-flowers
have a tubular perianth, (formed from two median leaves) which
surrounds a centrally-placed filament, bearing 2 anthers. In
the ♀-flower there is a similar perianth, surrounding an ovule
provided with 2 integuments. The perianth becomes fleshy and
envelops the hard seed. 20 species.</p>

<p>From the circumstance of <i>Welwitschia</i> having ♂ flowers
which, besides stamens, possess also a rudiment of an ovule,
Celakovsky draws the inference that the earliest Gymnosperms
had hermaphrodite flowers which from this structure became
differentiated entirely into ♂-and ♀-flowers, with the exception
of <i>Welwitschia</i> only, in which this differentiation was
only carried out in the ♀-flower. This theory has so far been
scarcely proved.</p>


<p class="center p1"><b>Fossil Gymnosperms.</b></p>

<p>The earliest continental plants which are known belong to the
<span class="smcap">Cordaitaceæ</span>, a group of plants which existed as early
as the Silurian period; they were Gymnosperms, but it has not
yet been determined whether they were Cycads or Conifers. The
<span class="smcap">Cycads</span>, even in the Coal period, were scarce; they
attained their fullest development in Jurassic and Cretaceous
periods, during which they were rich in species and genera,
and extended as far as the Polar regions. In addition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> to
these, Taxaceæ, Abietaceæ, and Taxodiaceæ appeared in the
Carboniferous period. The <span class="smcap">Taxaceæ</span> appear to have
attained their culmination in the Jurassic and Cretaceous
periods; <i>Ginkgo</i> appears in the Rhætic; <i>Torreya</i>,
in the Cretaceous; <i>Taxus</i> and <i>Podocarpus</i> in the
Tertiary periods. The <span class="smcap">Abietaceæ</span> also appear in the
Carboniferous; <i>Pinus</i> was first known with certainty
in the English Weald and in the Cretaceous; almost all other
contemporary genera are represented in this latter period. The
<span class="smcap">Araucariaceæ</span> first appear, with certainty, in the
Jurassic. The <span class="smcap">Taxodiaceæ</span> may be traced back as far as
the Carboniferous (?); <i>Sequoia</i> is first found in the
lowest Cretaceous, at that period it spread throughout the
entire Arctic zone, and being represented by a large number of
species, formed an essential part of the forest vegetation.
<i>Sequoia</i> played a similar part in the Tertiary period.
The <span class="smcap">Cupressaceæ</span> are first known with certainty in the
Jurassic, but they appeared more frequently and numerously in
the Tertiary period, in which most of the present living genera
were to be found. The <span class="smcap">Gnetaceæ</span>, according to a theory
advanced by Renault were represented in the Coal period by the
genus <i>Stephanospermum</i>, which had four ovules enclosed by
an envelope.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">DIVISION V.<br />
<span class="subhed">ANGIOSPERMÆ.</span></h2></div>

<p>See pages <a href="#Page_3">3</a> and <a href="#Page_224">224</a>. To this Division belong the majority of the
Flowering-plants. They are divided into two parallel classes, the
Monocotyledons and the Dicotyledons, which differ from each other not
only in the number of cotyledons, which, with a few exceptions, is one
in the former, two in the latter, but also in the internal structure
of the stem, the venation of the leaves, the number of the parts of
the flower, etc. <span class="smaller">Assuming that these two
classes have sprang from a common origin, it is amongst the Helobieæ
in the first, and amongst the Polycarpicæ in the second class that
we might expect to find closely allied forms, which might reasonably
be supposed to have varied less from this original type. As for the
rest, they seem to stand quite parallel, without exhibiting any close
relationship. It is scarcely proved that the Monocotyledons are the
older class.</span></p>

<p>[Our knowledge of the forms included under the Angiosperms has
recently been considerably increased by Treub (<i>Ann. d. Jar. Bot.
d. Buitenzorg</i>, 1891), who has shown that the Casuarinas differ
in many important points from the typical Angiosperms. Among other
characters the pollen-tube is found to enter the ovule near the chalaza
and therefore at the opposite end to the micropyle, and Treub therefore
suggests that these plants should be placed in a subdivision termed
Chalazogams.</p>

<p>According to this view the principal divisions of the Angiosperms would
be represented thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>More recently Nawaschin (<i>Bull. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersb.</i>,
ser. iii., xxxv.) has shown that <i>Betula</i>, and Miss Benson
(<i>Trans. Linn. Soc.</i>, 1894) that <i>Alnus</i>, <i>Corylus</i>, and
<i>Carpinus</i> also belong to the Chalazogams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span></p>

<p>Our knowledge, however, is still so incomplete that one would hesitate
to accord the full systematic value which Dr. Treub attaches to his
discovery until the limits of the Chalazogamic group are better
defined; and it would hardly be justifiable to include the Casuarinas
and the above-noted genera in one family.]</p>


<h3>Class 1. <b>Monocotyledones.</b></h3>

<p><i>The embryo has only one cotyledon; the leaves are as a rule
scattered, with parallel venation; the vascular bundles of the stem
are closed, there is no increase of thickness. The flower is typically
constructed of five 3-merous whorls, placed alternately.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The embryo</span> is generally small in proportion to the abundant
endosperm (exceptions, see <i>Helobieæ</i>), and its single cotyledon
is often sheath-like, and very large. On the germination of the seed
either the entire cotyledon, or its apex only, most generally remains
in the seed and absorbs the nutritive-tissue, while the lower portion
elongates and pushes out the plumule and radicle, which then proceed
with their further growth. The primary root in most cases soon ceases
to grow, but at the same time, however, numerous lateral roots break
out from the stem, and become as vigorous as the primary root, or even
more so. Increase in thickness does not take place in these roots; they
branch very little or not at all, and generally die after a longer or
shorter time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The stem</span> is frequently a corm, bulb, or other variety of
underground stem, as the majority of the Monocotyledons are perennial,
herbaceous plants; it has scattered, closed vascular bundles (Fig.
<a href="#fig276">276</a>), and no cambium by which a continuous thickening may take
place. The stem of the Palms, however, attains a very considerable
thickness, which is due to the meristem of its growing-point
continually increasing in diameter for a lengthened period (often for
many years), until it has reached a certain size. In this condition
the growing-point has the form of an inverted cone, and it is only
when this cone has attained its requisite size that the formation of
a vertical cylindrical stem commences. Certain tree-like Liliaceæ,
as <i>Dracæna</i>, <i>Aloe</i>, etc., have a continuous increase in
thickness; this is due to a meristematic layer, which arises in the
cortex, outside the original vascular bundles, which were formed at the
growing-point of the stem. This meristem continues to form thick-walled
parenchyma and new, scattered vascular bundles. The primary vascular
bundles, in the Palms and others, run in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> curved line from their
entrance into the stem at the base of the leaf, towards the centre of
the stem, and then bend outwards and proceed downwards in a direction
more parallel to the sides of the stem (Fig. <a href="#fig277">277</a>). The bundles formed
later, in those stems which increase in thickness, are not continued
into the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The branching</span> as a rule is very slight, the axillary buds of
the majority of the leaves never attaining development, <i>e.g.</i> in
the Palms, bulbous plants and others. As the cotyledon arises singly,
the succeeding leaves also must be scattered, but they are frequently
arranged in two rows (Grasses, Iris, etc). <i>The first leaf borne
on a branch</i> (the “Fore-leaf,”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;the bracteole, if on a floral
shoot) has generally, in the Monocotyledons, a characteristic form and
position, being situated on the posterior side of its own shoot, and
hence turned towards the main axis; it is sometimes provided with two
laterally-placed keels (Figs. <a href="#fig279">279</a> <i>f</i>, <a href="#fig290">290</a> <i>øi</i>), but the
midrib is often absent. It arises in some cases from two primordia,
which at the beginning are quite distinct, and thus has been regarded
as formed by two leaves. It is, however, only one leaf, a fact which is
evident from several circumstances, one being that it never supports
more than one shoot, and this stands in the median plane (Fig. <a href="#fig279">279</a>).</p>

course of the vascular bundles, from the stem into the leaves in a
Monocotyledon.</p>
  </div>

<p><span class="smcap">The leaves</span> are <i>amplexicaul</i>, and have a large sheath
but no stipules; the blade is most frequently long, ligulate, or
linear, entire, with parallel venation, the veins being straight or
curved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> (Figs. <a href="#fig300">300</a>, <a href="#fig309">309</a>). Connecting the large number of veins which
run longitudinally, there are as a rule only weak transverse ones. It
is very rarely that other forms of leaves are found, such as cordate
(Figs. <a href="#fig302">302</a>, <a href="#fig312">312</a>), or that the blade is branched, or the venation is,
for example, pinnate or palmate (Figs. <a href="#fig225">225</a>, <a href="#fig298">298</a>); these deviations are
especially found in the Araceæ, the Palms, the Scitamineæ (Fig. <a href="#fig308">308</a>),
the Dioscoreaceæ, and in several aquatic plants. The incisions in the
Palm-leaf are derived by the splitting of an originally entire leaf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The structure of the flower</span> is generally as follows: Pr3 +
3, A3 + 3, G3, rarely S3 + P3 with the other members unchanged.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Instead of 3, the numbers 2 and 4 may occur; rarely others. In all
these instances there are 5 whorls, which regularly alternate with one
another, most frequently in the 3-merous flower, as in the diagram
(Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>). This diagram is found in the following orders: Liliaceæ,
Convallariaceæ, Juncaceæ, Bromeliaceæ, Amaryllidaceæ, Dioscoreaceæ,
Palmæ, some Araceæ, and in some small orders, and may be considered as
the typical structure and also the starting point for the exceptional
orders. The ovary in many Monocotyledons has many ovules, and the fruit
becomes a many-seeded berry or capsule; this form is no doubt the
oldest. In others the number of seeds becomes reduced to 1, and the
fruit then becomes a cypsela, or a drupe (<i>e.g. Gramineæ</i>,
<i>Cyperaceæ</i>, <i>Palmæ</i>, etc).</p>

  </div>

<p>Deviations from this typical floral structure in some instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> may
be traced to <i>suppression</i>, very rarely to a <i>splitting</i> of
certain members, the typical relative positions not being changed.
Thus, the Iridaceæ, the Cyperaceæ, most of the Gramineæ and some
Juncaceæ deviate in having only 3 stamens (Fig. <a href="#fig279">279</a>), the inner whorl
(indicated by *) not becoming developed. The Musaceæ differ in the
posterior stamen not being developed; <i>Zingiberaceæ</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig314">314</a>),
<i>Marantaceæ</i>, and <i>Cannaceæ</i>, in the fact that only 1 of
all the stamens bears an anther, and the others are either suppressed
or developed into petaloid staminodes, with some perhaps cleft in
addition. The Orchideæ deviate in having, generally, only the anterior
stamen of all the 6 developed (Fig. <a href="#fig280">280</a>). In this, as in other
instances, the suppression of certain parts of the flower is often
connected with <i>zygomorphy</i> (<i>i.e.</i> symmetry in <i>one</i>
plane), chiefly in the inner perianth-whorl, but also in the other
whorls. In the Orchids, the perianth-leaf (the labellum, Fig. <a href="#fig280">280</a>
<i>l</i>) which is directly opposite the fertile stamen, is larger and
altogether different from the others. The perianth-leaves may also be
suppressed; see, for example, the two diagrams of the Cyperaceæ (Fig.
<a href="#fig284">284</a>). In some orders the suppression of these leaves, which form the
basis of the diagram, is so complete that it is hard to reduce the
actual structure of the flower to the theoretical type, <i>e.g.</i> the
Grasses (Fig. <a href="#fig290">290</a>) and <i>Lemna</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig303">303</a>). In the first family,
which especially comprises water-plants, a somewhat different structure
is found; thus Fig. <a href="#fig282">282</a> differs somewhat from the ordinary type, and
other flowers much more so; but the floral diagrams which occur in this
family may perhaps be considered as the most probable representatives
of an older type, from which the ordinary pentacyclic forms have taken
their origin. In favour of this theory we have the larger number of
whorls, the spiral arrangement of some of these in the flower, with
a large and indefinite number of stamens and carpels, the perfectly
apocarpous gynœceum which sometimes occurs, etc., etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Monocotyledons are divided into 7 Families:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Helobieæ.</span> This family forms a group complete in
itself. It commences with hypogynous, perfect flowers, whose
gynœcium is apocarpous and terminates in epigynous and more or
less reduced forms.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Glumifloræ.</span> These have as a starting point the
same diagram as the following families, but otherwise develope
independently.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Spadicifloræ.</span> Also an independent branch, or perhaps
two different ones which terminate in much reduced forms.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Enantioblastæ.</span> These ought perhaps to be amalgamated
with the following family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span></p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Liliifloræ.</span> These advance from forms with the
typical diagram and hypogynous flower, to epigynous and reduced
forms.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Scitamineæ</span> and</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Gynandræ.</span> Two isolated families, which probably have
taken their origin from Liliifloræ, and have epigynous, mostly
zygomorphic, and much reduced forms.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 1. <b>Helobieæ.</b></h4>

<p>To this family belong <i>only water- or marsh-plants</i>; <i>the
endosperm is wanting</i>, and they possess an embryo with a very
<i>large hypocotyl</i> prolonged downwards and often club-like. The
perianth is often differentiated into calyx and corolla; the flower
is regular, and in the first orders to be considered, may be reduced
to the ordinary Monocotyledonous type; there are, however, <i>usually
found two</i> 3-<i>merous whorls of carpels</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig282">282</a>), and thus in
all 6 whorls, or again, the <i>number of carpels may be indefinite</i>;
the number of stamens also may be increased, either by the division
of the members of a whorl, or by the development of additional
whorls. <i>Syncarps</i>,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> with nut or follicular fruitlets, are
<i>very common</i>, for example, in the first orders; in the last
(Hydrocharitaceæ) the carpels are not only united, but the ovary is
even inferior.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The primitive type appears to be a hypogynous flower, similar
to that of the Juncaginaceæ or Alismaceæ, with several 3-merous
whorls, and free carpels, each with many ovules; the green
perianth in this instance being no doubt older than the coloured
ones. If we take a flower with this structure as the starting
point, then the family developes partly into epigynous forms,
partly into others which are so strongly reduced and exceptional
that it is scarcely possible to refer them to the ordinary
type. The family, through the peculiar <i>Zostereæ</i>, appears
to approach the Araceæ, in which <i>Potamogetonaceæ</i> and
<i>Najadaceæ</i> are included by some authorities. However, the
inclusion of <i>Potamogeton</i>, and with it <i>Ruppia</i> and
<i>Zannichellia</i>, in the Juncaginaceæ appears quite correct.
It would scarcely be right to separate <i>Zostereæ</i> from
these. Great stress has often been laid upon the similarity with
the Ranunculaceæ which is found in the Alismaceæ, but it is
scarcely more than an analogous resemblance.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Juncaginaceæ.</b> The ☿, regular, <i>hypogynous</i>
flowers have the <i>perianth</i> 3 + 3, <i>sepaloid</i>, stamens 3
+ 3 (with extrorse anthers), and carpels 3 + 3 (free or united), of
which last, however, one whorl may be suppressed (in <i>Triglochin
maritima</i> all 6 carpels are developed, in <i>T. palustris</i>
the inner whorl is unfertile). Inflorescence long spikes.
Embryo <i>straight</i>.&mdash;Marsh-plants with radical, rush-like
leaves, arranged in two rows, and often sheathing and ligulate
(“squamulæ intravaginales”); the inflorescence is a spike or
raceme.&mdash;<i>Scheuchzeria.</i> Carpels almost free; in each at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
two ovules. Follicles.&mdash;<i>Triglochin</i> has long, fine racemes
without bracts or bracteoles; one ovule in each carpel. The carpels
in the two native species are united, but separate when ripe as a
schizocarp, loosening from below; they open along the ventral suture or
remain closed; a linear central column remains. <span class="smaller">The most reduced is
Lilæa (1–2 sp. Am.)&mdash;Protogynous. About 10 species. Temp. Fossils in
Tertiary.</span></p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Potamogetonaceæ.</b> The aquatic plants belonging to this
order are perennial, living entirely submerged, or with floating
leaves, and preferring still water. The leaves are alternate, in some
linear and grass-like, in others there is an elliptical floating blade,
supported by a linear submerged petiole. Axillary scales. The fruit is
generally a syncarp with <i>nuts</i> or <i>drupes</i>; the <i>embryo is
curved</i>, of very various forms.</p>

<p><i>Potamogeton</i> (Pond-weed). The rhizome is creeping, sympodial
(with two internodes in each shoot-generation); the inflorescence
is a terminal, many-flowered spike, without floral-leaves; below it
are found 2 foliage-leaves placed nearly at the same height, from
whose axils the branching is continued cymosely. The flowers are
☿, 4-<i>merous</i>, naked, and consist only of 4 <i>stamens</i>,
with the <i>connectives, broadly developed</i> at the back of the
anthers, <i>resembling a perianth</i>, and of 4 <i>free, sessile
carpels</i>. They are common plants in fresh water. <span class="smaller">The spike,
during the flowering, is raised above the water. Wind-pollinated and
protogynous.&mdash;Closely allied is <i>Ruppia</i> (Tassel Pond-weed), in
salt or brackish water. The spike has only two naked flowers, each
consisting of 2 stamens and 4 carpels. The stalks of the individual
carpels are considerably prolonged.&mdash;<i>Zannichellia</i> (Horned
Pond-weed) is monœcious; the ♀-flower consists of 4 (2–9) carpels, with
membranous, bell-shaped perianth; long styles; the ♂-flower has 1 (-2)
stamens. <i>Althenia.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Zostera</i> (Grass-wrack) is an entirely submerged, marine plant
with creeping rhizome (with displacement of buds) and strap-shaped
leaves. The flowering shoots are sympodia with displacement of the
axes (Fig. <a href="#fig281">281</a>). The inflorescence is a peculiar, flatly-compressed
spike, on <i>one</i> side of which the flowers are borne (Fig. <a href="#fig281">281</a>).
<span class="smaller">This inflorescence may be considered, no doubt correctly, to be
derived from the symmetrical spike of <i>Potamogeton</i> by strongly
dorsiventral development, and by a strong suppression of the floral
parts taking place simultaneously. Two rows of flowers are developed,
but of these one is so pressed into the other that apparently only one
is present.</span> Each flower consists of only 1 stamen and 1 carpel
situated at the same height (Fig. <a href="#fig281">281</a>); the unilocular ovary encloses
1 pendulous ovule and bears a bifid style. As regards the perianth
(?) one leaf may be present (<i>Z. nana</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig281">281</a> <i>D</i>). The
pollen-grains are filamentous. Pollination takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> place under water.
<span class="smaller"><i>Posidonia</i> and <i>Cymodocea</i> are allied to these. About 70
species.</span></p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Hydrocharitaceæ.</b> This order differs chiefly from
the preceding in its <i>epigynous</i> flowers. These are in general
unisexual (<i>diœcious</i>), and surrounded by a 2-leaved or bipartite
<i>spathe</i>; they are 3-merous in all whorls, but the number of
whorls is generally greater than 5, sometimes even indefinite. The
perianth is divided into <i>calyx</i> and <i>corolla</i>. The ovary
is <i>unilocular</i> with parietal placentation, or more or less
incompletely plurilocular. The fruit is berry-like, but usually
ruptures irregularly when ripe. Embryo straight.&mdash;Most often submerged
water-plants, leaves seldom floating on the surface. Axillary scales
(<i>squamulæ intravaginales</i>).</p>

<p><i>Hydrocharis.</i> Floating water-plants with round cordate leaves;
S3, P3 (folded in the bud); ♂-flowers: 3 (-more) flowers inside each
spathe; stamens 9–15, the most internal sterile. ♀-flowers solitary;
three staminodes; ovary 6-locular, with many ovules attached to
the septa; styles 6, short, bifid. [The petals of the ♀-flowers
bear nectaries at the base. In this and the following genus the
pollination is without doubt effected by insects.] <span class="smaller"><i>H. morsus
ranæ</i> (Frog-bit) has runners; it hibernates by means of special
winter-buds.</span>&mdash;<i>Stratiotes</i>; floating plants with a rosette of
linear, thick, stiff leaves with spiny margin, springing from a short
stem, from which numerous roots descend into the mud. Inflorescence,
perianth, and ovary nearly the same as in <i>Hydrocharis</i>, but
the ♂-flower has 12 stamens in 3 whorls, of which the outer 6 are
in 1 whorl (dédoublement), and inside the perianth in both flowers

diœcious; the ♂-flowers are detached from the plant, and rise to
the surface of the water, where they pollinate the ♀-flowers. These
are borne on long, spirally-twisted peduncles which contract after
pollination, so that the ♀-flower is again drawn under the water, and
the fruits ripen deeply submerged.&mdash;<i>Elodea canadensis</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> is also
an entirely submerged plant. The leaves are arranged in whorls on a
well-developed stem. Only ♀-plants in Europe (introduced about 1836

<h4>Family 2. <b>Glumifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The <i>hypogynous</i> flowers in the Juncaceæ are completely developed
on the <i>pentacyclic, trimerous</i> type, with <i>dry, scarious
perianth</i>. Even in these the interior whorl of stamens becomes
suppressed, and the ovary, which in <i>Juncus</i> is trilocular with
many ovules, becomes in <i>Luzula</i> almost unilocular, but still
with 3 ovules. The perianth in the Cyperaceæ and Gramineæ is reduced
from hairs, in the first of these, to nothing, the flowers at the same
time collecting more closely on the inflorescence (spike) supported
by <i>dry</i> bracts (<i>chaff</i>); the number of stamens is almost
constantly 3; stigmas linear; the ovary has only 1 loculus with 1
ovule, and the fruit, which is a capsule in the Juncaceæ, becomes a
nut or caryopsis.&mdash;The endosperm is large and floury, the embryo being
placed at its lower extremity (Figs. <a href="#fig286">286</a> <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig291">291</a>).&mdash;The plants
belonging to this order, with the exception of a few tropical species,
are annual or perennial herbs. The stems above ground are thin, and for
the most part have long internodes, with linear, parallel-veined leaves
which have long <i>sheaths</i>, and often a <i>ligule</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
a membranous projection, arising transversely from the leaf at the
junction of the sheath and blade. The underground stems are short or
creeping rhizomes. The flowers are small and insignificant. Wind- or
self-pollination.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Juncaceæ</b> (<b>Rushes</b>). The regular, hermaphrodite,
hypogynous flowers have 3 + 3 brown, dry, free perianth-leaves
projecting like a star during the opening of the flower; stamens 3 +
3 (seldom 3 + 0) and 3 carpels united into one gynœceum (Fig. <a href="#fig283">283</a>);
the ovary is 3- or 1-locular; there is as a rule 1 style, which becomes
divided at the summit into 3 stigmas, often bearing branches twisted
to the right (Fig. <a href="#fig283">283</a>). <i>Fruit a capsule</i> with loculicidal
dehiscence. The embryo is an extremely small, ellipsoidal, cellular
mass, without differentiation into the external organs.</p>

<p><i>Juncus</i> (Rush) has glabrous foliage-leaves, generally

and <i>3-seeded</i>.&mdash;<i>Prionium</i>: S. Africa; resembling a
<i>Tacona</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>interior</i> whorl of stamens, in some species,
disappears partially or entirely (<i>J. supinus</i>,
<i>capitatus</i>, <i>conglomerates</i>, etc.)</p>

<p>Some of the numerous <i>Juncus</i>-species (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>J. effusus</i>, <i>glaucus</i>, <i>conglomeratus</i>,
etc.), have false, lateral inflorescences, the axis of the
inflorescence being pushed to one side by its subtending
leaf, which apparently forms a direct continuation of
the stem, and resembles it both in external and internal
structure. The foliage-leaves of this genus were formerly
described as “unfertile stems,” because they are cylindrical,
erect, and resemble stems, and consequently the stem was
said to be “leafless”: <i>J. effusus</i>, <i>glaucus</i>,
<i>conglomeratus</i>. Stellate parenchynatous cells are found
in the pith of these stems and in the leaves. Other species
have distinct terminal inflorescences and grooved leaves;
<i>J. bufonius</i> (Toad-rush), <i>compressus</i>, and others.
The <i>inflorescences</i> most often present the peculiarity
of having the lateral axes protruding above the main axis.
Their composition is as follows:&mdash;The flowers have either no
bracteoles, and the inflorescences are then capitulate; or
they have 1–several bracteoles. Each branch has then, first,
a 2-keeled fore-leaf placed posteriorly (“basal-leaf”), and
succeeding this are generally several leaves borne alternately
and in the same plane as the basal-leaf, the two uppermost
(the “spathe-leaves”) being always barren; those which lie
between the basal-leaves and the spathe-leaves are termed
“intermediate-leaves.” If only branches occur in the axils
of the basal-leaves, then the succeeding branches are always
borne on the posterior side of the axis, and form a fan<a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>;
if the basal-leaf is barren, and if there is only one fertile
intermediate-leaf, then the lateral axes are always on the upper
side, and a sickle<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>-like inflorescence occurs; if there are 2
fertile intermediate-leaves, then a dichasium is formed, and in
the case of there being several, then a raceme, or spike.</p>

<p><i>Juncaceæ</i> are, by several authors, classed among the
Liliifloræ, but there are so many morphological and partly
anatomical features agreeing with the two following orders, that
they may, no doubt, most properly be regarded as the starting
point of these, especially of the <i>Cyperaceæ</i>, which they
resemble in the type of flowers, the inflorescence, the type of
mechanical system, and the stomata.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination</span> by means of the wind. Cross-pollination
is often established by protogyny. <i>J. bufonius</i> has
partly triandrous and cleistogamic, partly hexandrous, open

<p>Order 2. <b>Cyperaceæ.</b> The majority are <i>perennial</i> (seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
annual) <i>herbs</i> living in damp situations, with a sympodial
rhizome and grass-like appearance. The stems are seldom hollow, or
have swollen nodes, but generally <i>triangular</i>, with the upper
internode just below the inflorescence generally very long. The leaves
are often arranged in 3 <i>rows</i>, the leaf-sheath is <i>closed</i>
(very seldom split), and the ligule is absent or insignificant. The
flowers are arranged in <i>spikes</i> (<i>spikelets</i>) which may be
united into other forms of inflorescences (chiefly spikes or racemes).
The flowers are supported by a bract, but have <i>no bracteoles</i>.
In some genera the perianth is distinctly represented by six bristles
corresponding to six leaves (Figs. <a href="#fig284">284</a> <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig286">286</a> <i>A</i>); in
others it is represented by an indefinite number of hairs (Fig. <a href="#fig284">284</a>
<i>B</i>), and very frequently it is altogether wanting. <i>The inner
whorl of stamens is absent</i>, and the flower has therefore 3 stamens
(rarely more or less than 3), the anthers <i>are attached by their
bases to the filament</i> (innate) and are not bifid (Figs. <a href="#fig286">286</a>).
Gynœceum simple, formed of 3 or 2 carpels; 1 style, which is divided at
the extremity, as in the Juncaceæ, into 3 or 2 arms; the single loculus
of the ovary contains one basal, erect, anatropous ovule; the stigmas
are not feather-like. <i>Fruit a nut</i>, whose seed is generally not
united with the pericarp. The embryo is small, and lies at the <i>base
of the seed in the central line</i>, surrounded on the inner side by
the endosperm (Fig. <a href="#fig286">286</a> <i>B</i>). On germination the cotyledon <i>does
not remain</i> in the seed.</p>

lacustris</i>. <i>B</i> Seed of <i>Carex</i> in longitudinal section.</p>
  </div>

<p><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Cariceæ. Unisexual Flowers.</span></p>

<p>In the ♂-flowers there is no trace of a carpel, and in the ♀ no trace
of a stamen. Floral-leaves in many rows. In some (<i>Scleria</i>,
certain <i>Carex</i>-species), ♂-and ♀-flowers are borne in the same
spikelet, the latter at the base or the reverse; in the majority each
spikelet is unisexual.</p>

<p><i>Carex</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig285">285</a>) has <i>naked</i>, most frequently monœcious
flowers. The ♂-<i>spikes</i>, which are generally placed at the summit
of the whole compound inflorescence, are <i>not compound</i>; in the
axil of each floral-leaf (bract) <i>a flower is borne, consisting
only</i> of a short axis with three stamens (Fig. <a href="#fig285">285</a> <i>A</i>). The
♀-<i>spikes are compound</i>; in the axil of each floral-leaf is borne
a very small branch (Fig. <a href="#fig285">285</a> <i>D</i>, <i>a</i>) which <i>bears only
one leaf</i>, namely, a <i>2-keeled fore-leaf</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> (<i>utriculus</i>,
<i>utr.</i> in the figures) which is turned posteriorly (as the
fore-leaves of the other Monocotyledons), and being obliquely
sheath-like, envelopes the branch (in the same manner as the sheath of
the vegetative leaves), and forms a pitcher-like body. In the axil of
<i>this</i> leaf the ♀-flower is situated as a branch of the 3rd order,
bearing only the 2–3 carpels, which are united into one gynœceum. The
style protrudes through the mouth of the utriculus. <span class="smaller">The axis of
the 2nd order (<i>a</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig285">285</a> <i>D</i>) may sometimes elongate
as a bristle-like projection (normally in <i>Uncinia</i>, in which
it ends as a hook, hence the name); this projection is in most
cases barren, but it sometimes bears 1–several bracts which support
male-flowers; this is normal in <i>Elyna</i> (or <i>Kobresia</i>) and
<i>Schœnoxiphium</i>; the axis (<i>a</i> in 285 <i>E</i>) bears at
its base a female-flower supported by the utriculus, and above it a
male-flower supported by its bract.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination</span> by means of the wind. Protogynous.
Sometimes self-pollinated. The order embraces nearly
3,000 species, found all over the world. <i>Carex</i> and
<i>Scirpus</i> are most numerous in cold and temperate climates,
and become less numerous towards the equator. The reverse is
the case with <i>Cyperus</i> and other tropical genera. They
generally confine themselves to sour, swampy districts; some,
on the other hand, are characteristic of sand-dunes, such as
Sand-star (<i>Carex arenaria</i>). There are about 70 native
species of <i>Carex</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> In spite of their large number, the Cyperaceæ
are of no importance as fodder-grasses, as they are dry and
contain a large amount of silica; hence the edges of many of the
triangular stems or leaves are exceedingly sharp and cutting.
<i>Cyperus esculentus</i> has tuberous rhizomes, which contain
a large amount of fatty oil and are edible (earth-almonds); it
has its home in the countries of the Mediterranean, where it is
cultivated.</p>

<p><i>Cyperus papyrus</i> (W. Asia, Egypt, Sicily) attains a
height of several metres, and has stems of the thickness of an
arm which were used by the ancient Egyptians for making paper
(papyrus). Some serve for plaiting, mats, etc. (<i>Scirpus
lacustris</i>, etc.). <i>Isolepis</i> is an ornamental plant.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Gramineæ</b> (<b>Grasses</b>). The stems are cylindrical,
generally <i>hollow</i> with <i>swollen nodes</i>, that is, a swelling
is found at the base of each leaf which apparently belongs to the
stem, but in reality it is the swollen base of the leaf. The leaves
are <i>exactly alternate</i>; the sheath is <i>split</i> (excep.
<i>Bromus</i>-species, <i>Poa pratensis</i>, <i>P. trivialis</i>,
<i>Melica</i>, <i>Dactylis</i>, etc., in which the sheath is not
split), and the edges overlap alternately, the right over the left,
and <i>vice versâ</i>; the <i>ligule</i> is nearly always well
developed. In general, the flowers are hermaphrodite; they are borne in
<i>spikelets</i> with <i>alternate floral-leaves</i>, and the spikelets
themselves are borne in either <i>spikes</i> or <i>panicles</i>. The
two (seldom more) <i>lowest floral-leaves</i> in each spikelet (Fig.
<a href="#fig289">289</a> <i>øY</i>, <i>nY</i>) are <i>barren</i> (as the covering-leaves
in many umbels and capitula); these are termed the <i>glumes</i>.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> succeeding floral-leaves, each of which supports one flower
as its bract, are called the <i>outer pales</i> (<i>nI</i>); these
sometimes each bear an “awn” (a bristle-like body which projects in
the median line either from the apex or the back); sometimes the upper
ones are barren. Each flower has a <i>bracteole</i>, which is placed
on the inside opposite the main axis; it is thin, <i>binerved</i> or
<i>two-keeled</i>, and never has an awn; it is known as the <i>inner
pale</i> (<i>øI</i>). Immediately succeeding the bracteole are:
(<i>a</i>) some <i>small, delicate scales</i> (<i>lodicules</i>,
Figs. <a href="#fig287">287</a> <i>D</i>, <a href="#fig288">288</a> <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig290">290</a> <i>L</i>); (<i>b</i>) <i>three
stamens</i> with anthers <i>versatile</i>, so as to be easily moved,
and usually notched at each end (Fig. <a href="#fig287">287</a> <i>C</i>); and (<i>c</i>)
a simple gynœceum formed of <i>one carpel</i> with <i>two styles</i>
having generally <i>spirally-branched stigmas</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig287">287</a>
<i>D</i>, <a href="#fig288">288</a> <i>C</i>). The ovary is <i>unilocular</i>, and contains
one ascending or pendulous, anatropous ovule. <i>Fruit a nut</i>,
whose seed is always <i>firmly united with the thin pericarp</i>
(“caryopsis”). The embryo is larger than in the Cyperaceæ and is placed
at the base of the seed, but on the <i>outer convex surface</i> of
the pericarp (Figs. <a href="#fig287">287</a> <i>I</i>, <a href="#fig288">288</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> <a href="#fig288">288</a> <i>D</i>, <a href="#fig291">291</a>), <i>outside
the endosperm</i>; plumule large with several leaf-primordia. On
germination the cotyledon remains in the seed.</p>

<p>The majority of Grasses are annual or perennial herbs; tree-like forms
being only found in the Tropics, for example, the Bamboos; they branch
(in tufts), especially from the axils of the basal-leaves, while those
which are borne higher on the stem are separated by longer internodes
and have no vegetative branches in their axils, though a few forms,
like <i>Bambusa</i> and <i>Calamagrostis lanceolata</i>, produce
branches in these axils.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Only a few Grasses have a <i>solid stem</i>, such as Maize,
Sugar-cane, and <i>Andropogon</i>. The <i>blade</i> is
flat in the meadow-grasses, but the Grasses which live on
dry places (“prairie-grass”) exposed to the sun, often
have the blade tightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> rolled up and almost filiform
or bristle-like, with anomalous anatomical structure. A
<i>closed</i> tubular <i>sheath</i> is found in <i>Melica
uniflora</i>, <i>Bromus</i>-species, <i>Poa pratensis</i> and
<i>trivialis</i>, <i>Briza</i> and some <i>Glyceria</i>-species.
The sheath is developed for the purpose of supporting the young
internodes while their growth is proceeding at the base. The
“nodes” (the swollen joints which are seen on stems of Grasses)
are not really part of the stem but are formed by the base
of the leaf-sheath. They play a part in assisting the haulms
to regain a vertical position when laid prostrate by wind or
rain. The <i>awn</i> on the pale is homologous with the blade
of the Grass-leaf, and the pale itself is the sheath. The
arrangement of the leaves in the <i>spikelet</i> is similar to
that in <i>Cyperus</i> and other Cyperaceæ, their floral-leaves
being borne in several rows in <i>Streptochæta</i>. More
than two barren “glumes” are found in <i>Streptochæta</i>,
several Phalarideæ and others. The spikelets, too, are again
arranged in two rows in the axils of suppressed floral-leaves.
The inflorescence becomes a “compound spike” (ear) when the
spikelets are sessile. In the majority of instances the
spikelets are borne on long stalks; when these branch, then
the secondary branches, and similarly all branches of higher
order, are placed so far down upon the mother-axis that they
all appear to be of equal value and to arise in a semicircle
from the mother-axis itself, though in reality they arise from
each other (<i>Panicle</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig288">288</a> <i>A</i>). Sometimes the
main axis and branches of different orders unite together as
in <i>Alopecurus</i>, <i>Phleum</i>, and some other Grasses,
and hence the single (short-stalked) spikelets appear to arise
singly and spirally, or without any definite order, directly
from the main axis, with the production of a <i>cylindrical</i>
inflorescence bearing “spikes” <i>on all sides</i>, that
is, a “<i>spike-like panicle</i>.”&mdash;Many inflorescences are
somewhat dorsiventral. The <i>flower</i> is rarely unisexual
(<i>Zea mais</i>) or barren. Considerable difficulty is
experienced in reducing the Grass-flower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> to the ordinary
3-merous Monocotyledonous type. Some authorities consider the
<i>lodicules</i>, which are present in all Grasses but absent
in the Cyperaceæ, to be homologous with a perianth. According
to a more recent theory they are bracteoles, and hence the
Gramineæ, like many of the Juncaceæ, have 2–3 bracteoles placed
in two rows in the median plane. If this theory be correct, the
<i>flower is naked</i>. The lodicules expand quickly and cause
the opening of the flower (<i>i.e.</i> the two pales become
separated from each other). Generally only 3 <i>stamens</i>
belonging to the outer whorl are present (Fig. <a href="#fig290">290</a>), as in
<i>Iris</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig279">279</a>), certain Juncaceæ and Cyperaceæ (Fig.
<a href="#fig284">284</a>), but in some, such as the Rice and certain species of
Bamboos, all 6 are found. <i>Pariana</i> has more than 6. Only
1 of the <i>carpels</i> is present, namely, the anterior (of
those in Fig. <a href="#fig284">284</a>), so that the ventral suture and the place
of attachment of the ovule are situated at the back of the
ovary. The number of styles does not correspond with the number
of carpels, and the styles may therefore be supposed to arise
from the edges of the leaf to the right and left&mdash;a position
which is not without analogy. In addition, a stylar projection
is sometimes found on the anterior side and in the median line
(<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Phragmites</i>), and the solitary style in
<i>Nardus</i> has exactly this position; a similar arrangement
is found in some species of <i>Bambusa</i> which have only one
style; other species of <i>Bambusa</i> have three styles. A
tripartite style is found in <i>Pharus</i>.</p>

<p>[The Grass-flower may be reduced to the ordinary
Monocotyledonous type thus:&mdash;The outer pale is the bract of the
flower since it bears in its axil the floral shoot; the inner
pale occupies the customary position of the bracteole. The fact
that it is binerved can be explained by its having been pressed
against the main-axis during development. Similar binerved
bracteoles are found in <i>Iris</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig279">279</a>). These bracteoles
in both Grass and Iris arise from single primordia, and are not
produced by the coalescence of two leaves. The lodicules are the
only parts of the perianth remaining, the outer whorl having
been suppressed, and also the posterior leaf of the inner whorl;
a posterior lodicule, however, is found in the Rice and some
species of Bamboo. The outer whorl of stamens is usually absent,
though this again is present in the Rice and Bamboo. The three
carpels are reduced to one with two or sometimes three stigmas.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Flowering.</span> In the panicles the flowers open in
basipetal order; the flowers in the spikes situated somewhat
above the middle, commence to open first, and the flowering
proceeds upwards and downwards. A few Grass-flowers never open
(cleistogamic); <i>Leersia oryzoides</i>, <i>Stipa</i>-species,
and <i>e.g.</i> Wheat and Rye in cold damp weather; some open
their pales so wide that the anthers and stigmas may protrude
at the top; most frequently the lodicules expand and force
the pales suddenly and widely apart. The filaments elongate
considerably, so that the anthers are pendulous and the stigmas
unfold. In some Grasses <i>e.g.</i> Wheat, the blooming of
each flower only lasts a short time. <span class="smcap">Pollination</span>
is generally effected by the wind. The <i>Rye</i> separates
the pales very widely in the morning, and allows the anthers
and stigmas to appear; it is almost entirely sterile when
self-pollinated. The <i>Wheat</i> flowers at any time of the
day, each flower lasting only a quarter of an hour. The pales
open suddenly, but only half way, and the anthers scatter
one-third of the pollen in their own flower and two-thirds
outside. Self-pollination is effectual, but crossing gives
better results. In <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> (all flowers ☿)
the flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> of the 4 outer rows behave as in the Wheat,
but those in the two central rows always remain closed. The
☿-flowers in the two central rows of <i>H. distichum</i> remain
closed and fertilise themselves; they open exceptionally, and
may be pollinated by the ♂-flowers in the 4 lateral rows.
<i>H. hexastichum</i> is cleistogamic. <i>Oats</i> pollinate
themselves.</p>

<p><i>The ripe Grass-fruit</i>, in some species of Bamboo, is a
berry; in some other Grasses a nut with <i>loosely</i> lying
seed, in some even a capsule, but otherwise a “caryopsis.” In
some instances it is loosely enveloped by the pales (Oat),
in others firmly attached to these (Barley), and finally, in
others, “naked,” <i>i.e.</i> it is entirely free from the pales
(Wheat and Rye). On the ventral side there is a groove (Fig. <a href="#fig288">288</a>
<i>E</i>); on the anterior side (dorsal suture), which is turned
towards the inner pale, it is convex, and at the base on this
side, inside the testa, lies the embryo (Fig. <a href="#fig288">288</a> <i>D</i>). The
apex of the fruit is often hairy (Fig. <a href="#fig293">293</a>). The <i>skin</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig291">291</a>, <i>a</i>) is formed by the pericarp and testa, and
in some cases (Barley) the pales also form the outer portion.
The endosperm (<i>b</i>) is large, and formed of parenchymatous,
starch-containing cells: aleurone (proteid) grains may also be
found among them. When the starch-grains and the aleurone-grains
adhere together the endosperm becomes “horny,” but is “floury”
when the starch-grains lie loosely with air between them. In
the most external region, just beneath the skin, 1–several
layers of nearly cubical cells (filled principally with
aleurone-grains and fat) are found, the <i>aleurone</i>-layer
(Fig. <a href="#fig292">292</a>). The embryo (Fig. <a href="#fig291">291</a> <i>c-d</i>) contains large
quantities of fatty oil; the large shield-like structure,
attached to the embryo and turned inwards towards the endosperm
(<i>c</i>), is the cotyledon (scutellum); it remains enclosed
in the seed during germination, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> dissolves the endosperm by
means of the peculiar epithelial cells developed on the dorsal
surface. The radicle, on germination, is obliged to perforate
a mass of cells derived from the suspensor and which form the
“root-sheath” (coleorhiza, Fig. <a href="#fig293">293</a>) round its base. In addition
to the tap-root, lateral roots are frequently developed before
germination; these quickly break through, and later on are
followed by others which appear at the base of the leaf (Figs.
<a href="#fig293">293</a>, <a href="#fig294">294</a>).</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">DISTRIBUTION OF THE FRUIT</span> is most frequently
effected by the wind. The spirally-twisted and hygroscopic awn
which persists on the fruits of some species (<i>Avena</i>,
<i>Stipa</i>, etc.) assists in their dissemination, and even
helps to bury them in the ground.</p>

<p>The two preceding orders are more closely related to each other
than they are to the Gramineæ.</p>

<p>The generic differences are chiefly founded on the form of
the inflorescence, the number and sex of the flowers in the
spikelets, the shape and relative length of the pales, awns,
etc. In addition to these the structure of the fruit and
seed presents a great many differences; some have compound
starch-grains, while in others they are single; some have 1
layer of aleurone-cells, others have several (Fig. <a href="#fig292">292</a>), etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distribution.</span> 315 genera with 3,500 species. The order

broad-leaved, tree-like forms are found (<i>Bambuseæ</i>,
<i>Olyreæ</i>, <i>Andropogoneæ</i>, etc.; in S. Europe,
<i>Arundo donax</i>); in England, next to the Compositæ, it is
the order most rich in species (about 134).&mdash;The origin of some
of the cultivated Grasses is lost in obscurity. The Maize, no
doubt, was indigenous to America, where its nearest relatives
are found, and where it has also been discovered in ancient
Indian graves; Durra or Guinea-corn, Millet and Sugar-cane are
South Asiatic plants, and our own cereals no doubt have sprung
primarily from Western Asia and South-Eastern Europe (Barley
from Armenia and Persia, where a very closely related wild
species is found; Wheat from the same districts; Rye from the
perennial species <i>S. montanum</i>). <i>Panicum altissimum</i>
and Rice have come from Africa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> The Grasses play a very important part as
cereals and fodder plants. The following are the most important
of the cultivated ones: <i>Triticum vulgare</i> (common
Wheat), <i>turgidum</i>, <i>amyleum</i>, <i>polonicum</i>,
<i>spelta</i>, <i>durum</i>, etc.; <i>Secale cereale</i> (Rye);
Barley (<i>Hordeum</i>-species, see under the genus); Maize;

<h4>Family 3. <b>Spadicifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The primitive form resembles that of the preceding family. In it
we find the typical, perfectly developed, Monocotyledonous flower,
sometimes even with free carpels and with a dry or somewhat fleshy,
but never petaloid perianth; and this passes over into very different
forms by the suppression of the floral-leaves, perianth and sporophylls
(unisexual flowers are common), and by the close aggregation of the
flowers in the inflorescence. The flower is <i>hypogynous</i> in every
case. The inflorescence is a <i>spike</i> which may be either single or
branched, and has often a thick and fleshy axis (a <i>spadix</i>). In
Palms and Araceæ it is enveloped, at any rate prior to the opening of
the flowers, by a very large floral-leaf, <i>the spathe</i>, which may
be petaloid (Figs. <a href="#fig297">297</a>, <a href="#fig301">301</a>).</p>

<p>The fruit is most frequently fleshy (<i>berry</i>, <i>drupe</i>) or a
<i>nut</i>, never a capsule. The embryo is small, with large, fleshy
endosperm (Fig. <a href="#fig299">299</a> <i>C</i>); very rarely the endosperm is wanting.</p>

funifera</i> with persistent leaf-bases.</p>
  </div>

<p>The numerous plants belonging to this family are large, herbaceous or
tree-like, and the leaves seldom have the usual Monocotyledonous form,
<i>i.e.</i> linear with parallel venation, but most frequently have
pinnate or palmate venation.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Palmæ (Palms).</b> The majority are trees with an
<i>unbranched</i>, cylindrical <i>stem</i>, having short internodes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
and covered with leaf-scars or the bases of the leaf-stalks (Fig.
<a href="#fig296">296</a>), and at the summit a rosette of large leaves closely packed
together (Fig. <a href="#fig295">295</a>). An exception to this is found in <i>Calamus</i>
(Cane, “Rotang”), whose thin, creeping or climbing stems have long
internodes; sparsely<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> branched is, <i>e.g.</i> the African Doum-palm
(<i>Hyphæne</i>). Notwithstanding their often enormous stems the
Palms have fibrous roots, like the bulbous Monocotyledons. The leaves
are pinnate (Feather-palms, Fig. <a href="#fig298">298</a>) or palmate (Fan-palms, Fig.
<a href="#fig295">295</a>) and often very large; they have a well-developed petiole with
an <i>amplexicaul sheath</i>, which is often more or less separated
into a large number of fibres. <i>In the bud the blade is entire
but folded</i>, as the leaf expands the lines of folding are torn,
either those which are turned upwards (thus ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Pritchardia</i>, <i>Livistona</i>, <i>Phœnix</i>, <i>Chamærops</i>)
or those turned downwards (thus ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧, <i>e.g. Cocos</i>,
<i>Chamædorea</i>, <i>Calamus</i>). The inflorescence is usually
lateral; when, as in Sago-palm (<i>Metroxylon rumphii</i>) or Talipot
(<i>Corypha umbraculifera</i>) it is terminal, the plant is monocarpic,
and dies after flowering; it is often a very <i>large</i> and
<i>branched spadix</i> with numerous flowers either borne externally
or embedded in it, and enclosed either in one woody, boat-shaped
<i>spathe</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig297">297</a>) or several spathes, in the latter case one
for each branch. The flowers are sessile or even embedded, regular,
generally <i>unisexual</i> (monœcious or diœcious) with the usual
diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>); the perianth is inconspicuous, green or yellow,
persistent, and more or less leathery or fleshy. 6, rarely 3 or many
stamens. The 3 carpels remain either <i>distinct</i> or form one,
generally 3-locular, ovary. The style is short. There is <i>one ovule
in each carpel</i>. Often during ripening 2 carpels with their ovules
are aborted. The fruit is a <i>berry</i>, <i>drupe</i> or <i>nut</i>,
generally one-seeded, with a large horny or bony endosperm with hard
thick-walled cells (<i>e.g.</i> Date-palm). In some (<i>e.g.</i>
Cocoanut) it is thin-walled, soft, and oily; in several “ruminate.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When <i>germination</i> commences in the Cocoanut, Date, etc.,
the apex of the cotyledon remains in the seed and developes
into a spongy mass to withdraw the endosperm; in the Cocoanut
it attains a considerable size (Fig. <a href="#fig299">299</a> <i>C</i>) and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> assumes
the form of the fruit. The endosperm in the Cocoanut is hollow
and the interior is filled with “milk.” In the Date-palm and the
Vegetable-ivory (<i>Phytelephas</i>) the cell-walls of the hard
endosperm serve as reserve material.</p>

Europe only the Dwarf-palm (<i>Chamærops humilis</i>) is
wild (Western Mediterranean). The Date palm (<i>Phœnix
dactylifera</i>) belongs to North Africa and West Asia. Other
African genera are <i>Hyphæne</i> (Doum-palm) and <i>Elæis</i>
(<i>E. guineensis</i>, Oil-palm). A large majority of the
genera are found in South America and in the East Indies.
The following are <span class="smcap">American</span>:&mdash;<i>Mauritia</i>,
<i>Acrocomia</i>, <i>Bactris</i>, <i>Chamædorea</i>,
<i>Oreodoxa</i>, <i>Euterpe</i>, <i>Attalea</i>, etc.
<span class="smcap">Asiatic</span>:&mdash;<i>Metroxylon</i>, <i>Calamus</i>,
<i>Areca</i>, <i>Borassus</i>, <i>Lodoicea</i>
(“Double-cocoanuts,” Seychelles) and others. The Cocoanut-palm
has perhaps an American origin; all the other species of the
same genus being endemic in America; it is the only Palm found
on the coral islands of the Pacific Ocean, and is also the only
one which is common to both hemispheres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Palms belong to the most useful plants; they
contain no poison, and are of little medicinal interest,
but are largely employed in the arts and manufactures, the
hard timber being adapted for many purposes on account of
the hard tissue in which the vascular bundles are embedded.
“Cane” is the stem of <i>Calamus</i>-species (from India).
<span class="smcap">Sago</span> is obtained from the pith of <i>Metroxylon
rumphii</i> (Sago-palm, Sunda-Is., Moluccas), <i>Mauritia
flexuosa</i>, etc. Sugar-containing sap (“palm wine”) is
obtained from the American <i>Mauritia vinifera</i> and
<i>flexuosa</i>, <i>Borassus flabelliformis</i> (Asiatic
Palmyra-palm), <i>Arenga saccharifera</i>, etc., by cutting off
the young inflorescences, or by perforating the stem before the
flowering (<i>arrack</i> is distilled from this). <i>Vascular
strands</i> for the manufacture of mats and brushes, etc., are
obtained from the outer covering (mesocarp) of the Cocoanut,
and from the detached leaf-sheaths of <i>Attalea funifera</i>
(Brazil) (Fig. <a href="#fig296">296</a>). <span class="smcap">Wax</span> is yielded by the leaves
of <i>Copernicia cerifera</i> (carnaueba-wax, Amazon region),
and by the stem of <i>Ceroxylon andicola</i> (palm-wax,
Andes); East Indian <i>Dragon’s blood</i> is from the fruit of
<i>Calamus draco</i>; the young buds of many species, especially
<i>Euterpe</i>, <i>Cocos</i>, <i>Attalea</i>, etc., are used
as “cabbage.” Palm-oil is obtained from the oily mesocarp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> of
the plum-like fruits of <i>Elæis guineensis</i> (W. Africa),
and from the seeds, when it is largely used in the manufacture
of soap. <span class="smcap">Edible Fruits</span> from the Date-palm (<i>Phœnix
dactylifera</i>, Arabia, Egypt, W. Africa), and the endosperm of
the Cocoanut (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>). The seeds and the unripe
fruits of the Areca-palm (<i>Areca catechu</i>) are chewed with
the leaves of the Betelpeper, principally in Asia. <span class="smcap">Vegetable
Ivory</span> from the hard endosperm of <i>Phytelephas
macrocarpa</i> (S. America.)&mdash;Many species are cultivated in
the tropics as ornamental plants, but in this country only
<i>Chamærops humilis</i>, <i>Livistona australis</i> and
<i>chinensis</i> are generally grown. In addition to the few
just mentioned, many others are of importance, but these are
much the most useful.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Cyclanthaceæ.</b> This is a small order related to
the Palms (44 species from Tropical America), with fan-like,
folded leaves. The flowers are unisexual and arranged in whorls
or close spirals on an unbranched spadix. Ovary unilocular,
ovules numerous. To this belongs <i>Carludovica palmata</i>,
whose leaves are used for Panama hats.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Pandanaceæ</b> (Screw-pines) is another small order,
forming a transition to the Araceæ. The woody, (apparently)
dichotomous stem is supported by a large number of aerial roots,
which sometimes entirely support it when the lower portion of
the stem has decayed. The leaves are closely crowded together,
and arranged on the branches in three rows, which are often
obliquely displaced, with the formation of three spiral lines;
they are, as in the Bromeliaceæ, amplexicaul, long, linear,
the edge and lower midrib often provided with thorns. The
♂-flowers are borne in branched, the ♀ in unbranched spadices or
capitula, which resemble those of <i>Sparganium</i>, but have no
floral-leaves. Perianth absent. The drupes or berries unite into
multiple fruits.&mdash;About 80 species in the islands of the Indian
Ocean.&mdash;<i>Pandanus</i>, <i>Freycinetia</i>.&mdash;Fossils perhaps in
the chalk of the Harz.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 4. <b>Typhaceæ.</b> The flowers are unisexual, monœcious, and
borne on a cylindrical spike or globose capitulum; ♂ inflorescences
above, the ♀ below. The perianth consists of a definite number
of scales (<i>Sparganium</i>), or in its place numerous
irregularly-arranged hairs are found (<i>Typha</i>); in the ♂-flower
there are generally three stamens; the gynœceum is formed of 1–2
carpels with 1 prolonged style; 1 pendulous ovule. The seeds are
furnished with a seed-cover, which is cast off on germination.&mdash;The few
species (about 20) which belong to this order are marsh plants with
creeping rhizome (and hence grow in clusters); the leaves on the aerial
shoots are borne in two rows, entire, very long and linear.</p>

<p><i>Sparganium</i> (Bur-reed). The flowers are borne in globose
capitula; the perianth distinct, generally consisting of 3 small
scales; pistil bicarpellate. Drupe, dry and woody. <span class="smaller">The stalk
of the lower ♀ capitula is sometimes united with the main axis,
and consequently the capitula are situated high above their
subtending-leaf.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span></p>

<p><i>Typha</i> (Bulrush, Reed-mace) has a long, cylindrical, brown
spike, the lower portion bearing ♀-flowers, and the upper ♂-flowers,
which is divided into joints by alternate leaves. The ♀-flowers have
1 carpel. The perianth is wanting, represented by a number of fine,
irregularly-placed hairs; pistil unicarpellate. Fruit a nut.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The two genera, according to some, are related to the 2nd
order. In both genera native species are found. The pollination
is effected by the wind, and consequently the anthers project
considerably, and the stigma is large and hairy. <i>Typha</i>
is protandrous, <i>Sparganium</i> protogynous. The small,
fine hairs surrounding the nut of <i>Typha</i> assist in its
distribution by the wind.&mdash;Fossil <i>Typhas</i> in the Tertiary.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 5. <b>Araceæ</b> (<b>Arums</b>). The flowers are small,
and always borne <i>without bracts or bracteoles</i> on <i>an
unbranched</i>, often very fleshy spike, which is enclosed by a spathe,
often petaloid and coloured (Fig. <a href="#fig301">301</a>). The fruit is a <i>berry</i>.
Outer integument of the seed fleshy.&mdash;The leaves have generally sheath,
stalk, and blade with distinctly <i>reticulate</i> venation; they are
chiefly cordate or sagittate (Fig. <a href="#fig302">302</a>), seldom long with parallel
venation as in the other Monocotyledons (<i>Acorus</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig300">300</a>). The
Araceæ are quite <i>glabrous</i>, generally <i>perennial herbs</i>
with tubers or rhizomes. Many have latex.&mdash;For the rest the structure
of these plants varies; for example, while some have a perianth, in
others it is wanting; in some the perianth-leaves are free, in others
united; some have hermaphrodite flowers, but the majority unisexual
(monœcious); some have free, others united stamens; the ovules are
orthotropous, anatropous, or campylotropous, erect or pendulous;
the ovary is 1–many-locular; some have seeds with endosperm, others
without. <span class="smaller"><i>In habit</i> there are great differences. While some,
<i>e.g. Colocasia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig302">302</a>), have a thick, more or less
upright stem, with leaf-scars, but not woody, others are climbers,
epiphytic, and maintain themselves firmly by means of adventitious
roots, on the stems and branches of trees, or even on steep rocks,
<i>e.g. Philodendron</i>; the cordate, penninerved leaf is the
most common (Fig. <a href="#fig302">302</a>), but various branched forms appear; the pedate
leaves of <i>Helicophyllum</i>, <i>Dracunculus</i>, etc., are cymosely
branched; the leaves of <i>Monstera deliciosa</i>, perforated by
tearing, should be noticed (the vascular bundles while in the bud grow
faster than the tissue between them, causing the latter to be torn,
and the leaf perforated). With regard to the anatomical structure,
the presence or absence of latex, raphides, resin-passages, groups of
mucilage-cells should be noted. Engler makes use of these anatomical
peculiarities for a scientific arrangement of the order.</span></p>

The spadix terminates in a naked, club-like portion (<i>k</i>); below
this is a number of sessile bodies (rudimentary flowers), with broad
bases and prolonged, pointed tips (<i>b</i>); underneath these are the
♂-flowers (<i>m</i>), each consisting only of 3–4 short stamens, which
eject vermiform pollen-masses through the terminal pores; then follow,
last of all, ♀-flowers (<i>f</i>), each of which consists of one
unilocular ovary, with several ovules. Perennial herbs, tuberous, with
cordate leaves.&mdash;<span class="smaller"><i>Dracunculus</i>; <i>Biarum</i>; <i>Arisarum</i>;

<i>Zantedeschia æthiopica</i> (<i>Richardia</i>, Nile-lily); ♂, 2–3
stamens; ♀ with 3 staminodes, 1–5-locular ovary (S. Africa.)&mdash;In some
genera sterile flowers are present between the ♂ and ♀ portions of
the spadix (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Philodendron</i>); in <i>Ambrosinia</i>
a lateral, wing-like broadening of the axis of the spadix divides
the cavity of the spathe into two chambers, the anterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> containing
one ♀, and the posterior 8–10 ♂-flowers in two series; in some
the stamens in the single ♂-flowers unite and form a columnar
“synandrium” (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Dieffenbachia</i>, <i>Colocasia</i>,
<i>Alocasia</i>, <i>Caladium</i>, <i>Taccarum</i>, <i>Syngonium</i>).
A remarkable spadix is found in <i>Spathicarpa</i>; it is united for
its entire length, on one side, with the spathe, and the flowers are
arranged upon it in rows, the ♀ to the outside, and the ♂ in the middle
(<i>Zostera</i> has a similar one).&mdash;<i>Pistia</i> similarly deviates
considerably, it is a floating water-plant, with hairy, round rosettes
of leaves; in it also the spathe and spadix are united; at the base a
♀-flower is borne, which consists of one unilocular ovary, and above
several ♂-flowers, each composed of two united stamens.</span></p>

<p><span class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Biology.</span> The inflorescences are adapted for
<i>insect-pollination</i>; they are protogynous, since the viscous,
almost sessile stigmas come to maturity and wither before the pollen,
which is generally dehisced by apical pores, is shed; some pollinate
themselves freely by the pollen from the higher ♂-flowers falling
upon the ♀-flowers below them, and in some it is conjectured that the
pollination is effected by snails. The coloured spathe, and the naked
end of the spadix (often coloured) of certain genera function as the
coloured perianth in other orders; during flowering a very powerful
smell is often emitted. <i>Arum maculatum</i> is worthy of notice;
small flies and midges creep down into the spathe, between the sterile
flowers (Fig. <a href="#fig301">301</a> <i>b</i>), which are situated where the spathe is
constricted, and pointing obliquely downwards prevent the escape of the
insects; in the meantime, the stigmas are in a condition to receive any
pollen they may have brought with them; after pollination the stigmas
wither, and exude small drops of honey as a compensation to the flies
for their imprisonment; after this the anthers (<i>m</i>) open and shed
their pollen, the sterile flowers wither, and the insects are then able
to escape, and enter and pollinate other inflorescences.&mdash;In many, a
<i>rise of temperature</i> and evolution of carbonic acid takes place
during flowering; a spadix may be raised as much as 30°C. above the
temperature of the surrounding air.&mdash;Again, under certain conditions,
many species absorb such large quantities of water by their roots that
water is forced out in drops from the tip of the leaf; this may often
be observed in <i>Zantedeschia</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smaller">About 900 species in 100 genera. Home, the Tropics, especially S.
America, India, and the Indian Islands, preferably in shady, damp
forests growing as epiphytes upon trees, and on the banks of streams.
Outside the Tropics few are found. <i>Acorus calamus</i> was introduced
into Europe from Asia about 300 years ago; it, however, never sets any
fruit, as the pollen is unfertile. In England <i>Arum maculatum</i>
is a very common plant; this and <i>A. italicum</i> are the only
native species. <i>Colocasia antiquorum</i> comes from Polynesia and
the Indian Islands, and also <i>Alocasia macrorrhiza</i>. Fossils in
Cretaceous and Tertiary.</span></p>

<p><span class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Many species have pungent, and even <i>poisonous
properties</i> (<i>e.g. Dieffenbachia</i>, <i>Lagenandra</i>,
<i>Arum</i>), which are easily removed by boiling or roasting; the
<i>rhizomes</i> of many species of <i>Caladium</i>, <i>Colocasia</i>
(<i>C. antiquorum</i>, <i>esculenta</i>, etc.), are very rich in
starch, and in the Tropics form an important source of food. An
uncommon occurrence in the order is the highly aromatic rhizome
of <i>Acorus calamus</i>; this contains calamus-oil and acorin
which are used in perfumery. Many are ornamental plants, <i>e.g.
Zantedeschia æthiopica</i> (South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> Africa), generally known as “Calla,”
and <i>Monstera deliciosa</i>; many other species are grown in
greenhouses.</span></p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Lemnaceæ (Duck-weeds).</b> These are the most reduced
form of the Spadicifloræ. They are very small, free-swimming
water-plants. The vegetative system resembles a small, leaf-like
body (Fig. <a href="#fig303">303</a> <i>f-f</i>), from which roots hang downwards; this
branches by producing a new, similar leaf-like body, which springs
from a pocket-like hollow (indicated by a dotted line in the figure)
on each side of the older one, at its base (or only on one side).
<span class="smaller">The branching is thus dichasial or helicoid (Fig. <a href="#fig303">303</a> <i>A</i>,
where <i>f, f′, f″, f″′</i> indicate shoots of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
generations respectively). The leaf-like bodies are, according to
Hegelmaier, leaf-like stems, and thus <i>Lemna</i> has no other leaves
than the spathe and the sporophylls; according to the investigations
of Engler they are stems whose upper portion (above the “pocket”) is a
leaf, which is not sharply separated from the underlying stem-portion.
The inflorescence is a very much reduced Araceous-spadix, consisting
in <i>Lemna</i> of 1 or 2 stamens of unequal length (1-stamened
♂-flowers), 1 unilocular carpel (♀-flower), and 1 thin spathe
(<i>B</i>). [The same is found in <i>Spirodela polyrrhiza</i>, etc.,
whose daughter-shoots begin in addition with 1 basal-leaf. <i>Wolffia
arrhiza</i>, etc., have no roots, no spathe, and only 1 ♂-flower in
the inflorescence (Engler).]&mdash;On the germination of the seed a portion
of the testa is thrown off as a lid, so that an exit is opened for
the radicle.&mdash;19 species. In stagnant fresh water, both Temp. and

<h4>Family 4. <b>Enantioblastæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers in this family are <i>hypogynous</i> and have in part
the general monocotyledonous type with 5 trimerous whorls completely
developed in a regular hermaphrodite flower, and in part the flowers
so much reduced that the type is very difficult to trace. On the one
hand the family is well developed and has capitate inflorescences
(<i>Eriocaulaceæ</i>) and on the other hand it is distinctly reduced
(<i>Centrolepidaceceæ</i>). This family has taken its name from the
fact that the ovule is not, as in the Liliifloræ and nearly all other
Monocotyledons, anatropous, but <i>orthotropous</i>, so that the
embryo (βλάστη) becomes placed <i>at the end of the seed opposite</i>
(ἐναντίος) <i>to the hilum</i>. Large, mealy endosperm.&mdash;The orders
belonging to this family are by certain authors grouped with the
<i>Bromeliaceæ</i> and <i>Pontederiaceæ</i>, etc., into one family,
<span class="smcap">Farinoseæ</span>, so named on account of the mealy endosperm,
the distinguishing character of the Liliifloræ then being that the
endosperm is fleshy and horny.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Commelinaceæ.</b> The complete Liliaceous structure
without great reductions in the number of whorls, but with
generally few ovules in each loculus of the ovary, is found in
the Commelinaceæ, an almost exclusively tropical order with
about 317 species; herbs, some of which are introduced into
our gardens and greenhouses. The stems are nodose; the leaves
often <i>clasping</i>; the flowers are arranged in unipared
scorpioid cymes, often so that they form a zig-zag series
falling in the median line of the bracts, and after flowering
they bend regularly to the right or left, outwards or inwards.
They are more or less <i>zygomorphic</i>, particularly in the
stamens, which in the same flower are of different forms or
partially suppressed. The outer series of the <i>perianth</i>
is sepaloid, the inner petaloid, generally violet or blue; the
filaments are sometimes clothed with hairs formed of rows of
bead-like cells (well known for showing protoplasmic movements).
Fruit a trilocular <i>capsule</i> with loculicidal dehiscence
(generally few-seeded); in some a nut. The radicle is covered
by an external, warty, projecting covering which is cast off on
germination.&mdash;The abundant raphides lie in elongated cells whose
transverse walls they perforate.&mdash;<i>Commelina, Tradescantia,
Tinantia, Cyanotis, Dichorisandra</i>.</p>

<p>The flower is constructed on the general monocotyledonous type, with 5
alternating, 3-merous whorls (Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>), but exceptions are found as in
the Iridaceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig279">279</a>) by the suppression of the <i>inner</i> whorl of
stamens; in a few the position in relation to the bract differs from
that represented in Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>, and in some instead of the trimerous,
di- or tetramerous flowers are found (<i>e.g. Majanthemum</i>,
<i>Paris</i>). Flowers generally <i>regular, hermaphrodite</i>, with
simple, <i>petaloid</i>, coloured perianth (except, for example,
Bromeliaceæ); ovary trilocular, generally with 2 ovules or 2 rows
of ovules in the inner angle of each loculus (Fig. <a href="#fig304">304</a> <i>C</i>,
<i>D</i>). <i>Endosperm</i> always present.&mdash;A very natural family,
of which some divisions in part overlap each other. The habit varies;

<p>Perennial herbs with a very <i>characteristic appearance</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig310">310</a>); the stem is most often short, thick, and crowned by a
<i>rosette</i> of many leaves, which are long, often very narrow,
<i>leathery</i>, stiff, and with a <i>spiny</i> edge; they are
usually channeled, completely closing round each other, with their
edges forming a tightly closed hollow, in which generally water is
collected (this among other things insulates the inflorescence and thus
prevents the access of creeping insects, such as ants). The presence
of numerous stellate, water-containing hairs often gives the leaves a
grey appearance, and the layers of cells beneath the upper epidermis
of the lamina form an “aqueous tissue,” which serves as a protection
against the rays of the sun and regulates the evaporation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> stomata
are often situated in furrows on the underside of the leaf, and hence
cause a striped appearance. They <i>are all American</i> (525 species),
especially from S. America, where they live partly as epiphytes <i>on
trees</i>, partly in the <i>clefts of rocks</i>, often on the steepest
slopes, to which they firmly attach themselves by aerial roots; some
are terrestrial. The stem is seldom tree-like or many metres in
height (<i>Puya</i>, in Chili; <i>Hechtia</i>, in Mexico). <i>The
inflorescence</i> is a terminal spike, raceme, or panicle, often with
large and brightly-coloured floral-leaves. The flowers are without

<p>Order 8. The <b>Iridaceæ</b> have <i>epigynous</i>, hermaphrodite
flowers with petaloid perianth as in the Amaryllidaceæ, but the
<i>interior whorl of stamens is entirely suppressed</i>, and the 3
developed <i>outer</i> stamens have <i>extrorse</i> anthers (Fig.
<a href="#fig279">279</a>); there is 1 style with 3 large, generally <i>more or less
leaf-like branches bearing the stigmas</i>. Ovary and capsule as
in the Amaryllidaceæ and Liliaceæ.&mdash;Perennial herbs; <i>bulbs are
rarely found</i>, but horizontal rhizomes, corms, etc., take their
place. The leaves are (except <i>Crocus</i>) as in the <i>Iris</i>,
<i>two-rowed</i>, <i>equitant</i> and <i>sword-like</i>. Flowers or
inflorescences terminal.</p>

<p>The <i>Iris</i> (Flag) has a horizontal rhizome. The flowers are
borne in the leaf-axils in fan-like inflorescences (rhipidium). The
branches of the style are large and <i>petaloid</i>; on their under
surface may be seen a small projecting shelf (Fig. <a href="#fig312">312</a> <i>a</i>)
having on its upper surface the stigmatic hairs. Beneath the branches
of the style are 3 well protected stamens, and immediately outside
these the external perianth-leaves. <span class="smaller">The honey is secreted in the
perianth-tube, and the insects, endeavouring to obtain it through the
narrow passages at the base of the stamens, settle upon the outer
perianth-leaves, which are bent backwards and often very hairy along
their central line. The insects then rub their backs on the anthers
just above them, beneath the branches of the style; they readily
deposit the pollen on the stigma of another flower as they enter it,
but cannot do so in withdrawing, since the stigma is pushed back, and
self-fertilisation is thus avoided. The stylar branches lie close to
the outer perianth-leaves, which are just beneath them, or separated
by a distance of only 6–10 mm.; the first form of flower is adapted

large <i>tuberous rhizomes</i> (or roots); <i>twining</i> stems;
leaves stalked, often arrow- or heart-shaped, lobed, <i>palminerved</i>
and <i>finely reticulate</i> as in the Dicotyledons (Fig. <a href="#fig313">313</a>). The
flower is <i>diclinous</i> (most frequently <i>diœcious</i>), regular,
<i>epigynous</i>, <i>small</i>, and of a <i>greenish colour</i>, but
otherwise typical (Pr3 + 3, and A3 + 3, or G3); in most instances
2 ovules are placed one above the other in each loculus. The
inflorescence is a <i>spike</i> or <i>raceme</i>, sometimes richly
branched and paniculate.&mdash;The order approaches most nearly to the
Amaryllidaceæ.</p>

<p><i>Tamus</i> (Bryony) has a berry, <i>Dioscorea</i> (Yam) a
thin-walled, 3-edged or 3-winged capsule (Fig. <a href="#fig313">313</a>). Both have
subterranean or aerial tubers; the Yam very often also developes
tubers in the axils of the foliage-leaves; tuberous roots are said to
occur in <i>D. batatas</i>. The tubers of many species of Yams (<i>D.
batatas</i> from China and Japan, <i>D. alata</i>, South Sea Islands
and India, <i>D. bulbifera</i>) are a very important source of food
in the Tropics, especially the first-named.&mdash;<i>Testudinaria</i>;

<h5>Family 6. <b>Scitamineæ.</b></h5>

<p>The flowers belong to the ordinary monocotyledonous type. They are
hermaphrodite, <i>epigynous</i>, and have either a petaloid perianth,
or calyx and corolla; they are, however, <i>zygomorphic</i> or
<i>unsymmetrical</i>, and of the stamens most frequently only one is
<i>completely developed</i>, the others being generally represented
by petaloid staminodes. The ovary has 3 loculi, more rarely it is
unilocular with the suppression of 2 loculi. Endosperm is absent
(except <i>Zingiberaceæ</i>); but, on the other hand, there is a
<i>large perisperm</i>. To this family belong large, glabrous,
especially <i>perennial herbs</i> with rhizomes; leaves large,
distinctly divided into sheath, stalk, and blade, the latter being more
or less elliptical or lanceolate, entire, with pinnate venation, and
always with a very <i>well-pronounced midrib</i>, gradually tapering
towards the apex, and giving off numerous branches, which run outwards,
towards the margin, at a larger or smaller angle; these <i>lateral
veins</i> are closely packed, and parallel, but with only weak,
connecting branches between them; the leaves, therefore, are easily
torn pinnately (Figs. <a href="#fig314">314</a>, <a href="#fig317">317</a>). The leaf-sheaths close tightly round
each other and form a false stem.</p>

<p>This very natural family comprises orders closely connected with each
other, but is not itself nearly allied to any other family. First in
the series stands:&mdash;</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Musaceæ.</b> The <i>petaloid</i> perianth is strongly
zygomorphic, the anterior leaf being very large (a kind of “labellum”),
the posterior one small; only the posterior stamen is wanting, or is
rudimentary, the other five are developed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> have quadrilocular
anthers; ovary, 3-locular. Seed with straight embryo in mealy perisperm.</p>

  </div>

<p>The best-known genus is <i>Musa</i>, the Banana (Fig. <a href="#fig314">314</a>). From the
short rhizome arise enormously large, spirally-placed leaves, whose
sheaths envelope one another, and form an apparently aerial stem,
several metres in height. The inflorescence is a terminal <i>spike</i>
with floral-leaves placed spirally, and sometimes magnificently
coloured; in the axils of each of these several flowers are situated
in two transverse rows (accessory buds); the lowest flowers in the
inflorescence are ♀, the central ones ☿, the upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> ones ♂, so that
fruits are only found in the lower region of the inflorescence, the
remaining portion persisting as a naked axis after the floral-leaves
and flowers have fallen off; the inflorescence terminates in an ovoid
bud formed by the flowers which have not yet opened (Fig. <a href="#fig314">314</a>, the
left-hand figure). The perianth-leaves are united (except the posterior
one). The fruit (known as a “Banana”) is a <i>berry</i>, having the
form of a smooth, short, three-cornered Cucumber (as much as 30 cm.
in length); inside the tough skin is found a farinaceous, aromatic
pulp. No seed is developed in the cultivated species.&mdash;<span class="smaller">Several
<i>Musa</i>-species are cultivated in the Tropics for the sake of
the fruit (<i>M. paradisiaca</i>, <i>M. sapientum</i>); for the
fibrovascular bundles, <i>M. textilis</i> (Manilla Hemp).&mdash;Their home
is, no doubt, the Tropics of the Old World; they were introduced into
America before the arrival of Europeans. <i>Musa ensete</i> has dry,
leathery fruits; an ornamental plant.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In <i>Musa</i> the barren, posterior stamen belongs to the inner
whorl; and also in <i>Strelitzia</i> and <i>Ravenala</i>; the
latter may have all 6 stamens developed. In <i>Heliconia</i>, on
the contrary, it belongs to the outer whorl; in <i>Heliconia</i>
the perianth-leaves are differently arranged, and there is only
one ovule in each loculus. The three latter genera have dry
fruits and leaves arranged in two rows. In the “Travellers’
Palm” (<i>Ravenala madagascariensis</i>) the foliage-leaves form
an enormous fan.&mdash;Tropical; about 50 species.</p>
</div>

<p>The order may be divided as follows:&mdash;1. Museæ: <i>Musa</i>,
<i>Ravenala</i>, <i>Strelitzia</i> in the Old World. 2. Heliconiæ:
<i>Heliconia</i> in the New World.</p>

the “labellum” (Fig. <a href="#fig315">315</a> <i>lab</i>), which usually is the largest
segment of the flower, and is often bilobed. Ovules many. The fruit in
some is a leathery, 3-valved capsule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> with loculicidal dehiscence; in
others it is more or less berry-like and indehiscent, or irregularly
dehiscent. Straight embryo.&mdash;The aerial stem is seldom developed to
any extent, and the inflorescences, which are (compound) spikes or
racemes, often with coloured floral-leaves, spring in some (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Zingiber officinale</i>) directly from the rhizome. The leaves are
arranged in two rows.&mdash;The ovary in a few instances (<i>Globba</i> and

<h4>Family 7. <b>Gynandræ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers are hermaphrodite and constructed on the ordinary 3-merous,
pentacyclic type with petaloid, <i>epigynous, strongly zygomorphic</i>
perianth, and generally <i>one-stamened</i> by the suppression of the
other 5 stamens. The family has derived its name from the fact that the
stamen is united with the style into a “<i>stylar column</i>” (except
<i>Burmanniaceæ</i>). All are herbs; many grow as epiphytes on other
plants.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This family and the Scitamineæ occupy correspondingly high
positions among the Monocotyledons; these two families may
therefore be placed close together, although one cannot be
derived from the other. The first of the two orders is very
small, but the second is very rich in species. The Apostasieæ
are best classed with the Orchidaceæ and have no independent
place.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Burmanniaceæ.</b> This order forms a transitional
link between the Gynandræ and the epigynous Liliifloræ
(<i>Amaryllidaceæ</i>), in having a 6-leaved perianth, and 6–8
stamens; but some have a labiate perianth (the median perianth-leaf
of the <i>outer</i> whorl being very large). The ovary is most
frequently unilocular with three parietal placentæ; but in some
it is 3-locular with axile placentation. Capsule. Seeds ∞, small,
with <i>endosperm</i>. The relationship to the Orchidaceæ is shown
especially in the very imperfectly developed embryo and in the ovary.
Small, tropical herbs (59 species); some are saprophytes.</p>

  </div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Orchidaceæ.</b> The epigynous, petaloid perianth is
strongly zygomorphic in having the <i>posterior</i> leaf of the
interior whorl, the <i>lip</i> (labellum), differing from all the
other leaves in form, size, and colour (except <i>Apostasieæ</i>); the
position of the labellum is very frequently reversed, being turned
<i>forwards and downwards</i> by the twisting of the ovary (Fig. <a href="#fig318">318</a>
<i>A</i>). <i>Only</i> 1 of the stamens&mdash;the anterior of the external
whorl&mdash;is developed and bears an anther (by the twisting of the ovary
it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> turned posteriorly and upwards); the others are entirely wanting
(indicated by * in Fig. <a href="#fig318">318</a> <i>A</i>) or present as staminodes (Fig.
<a href="#fig318">318</a> <i>A</i>, δ δ) (except <i>Apostasieæ</i>, <i>Cypripedileæ</i>);
the filaments are united with the style to form a column (Fig. <a href="#fig318">318</a>
<i>B</i>), the <i>stylar-column</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (<i>gynostemium</i>), and the
anther (<i>a</i>) is thus placed on its apex and exactly behind or
over the stigma (<i>s</i>). The anther is 4-locular; the pollen-grains
do not separate (except <i>Apostasieæ</i>, <i>Cypripedileæ</i>) but
remain united either in tetrads or in masses, which correspond to a
pollen-mother-cell (Fig. <a href="#fig320">320</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>); or the
pollen-grains, formed in each of the two anther-halves, remain united
and form one or a few wax-like masses (pollen-masses, pollinia). The 3
carpels form a <i>unilocular ovary</i> with 3 parietal, deeply bifid
placentæ (except <i>Apostasieæ</i>, <i>Selenipedilum</i>). Only the
two lateral carpels are prolonged and developed into the stigma (Fig.
<a href="#fig318">318</a> <i>B</i>, <i>s</i>), while the one lying in the median line, which
is situated just within the anther (Fig. <a href="#fig318">318</a> <i>A</i>), becomes either
rudimentary or developed into the “<i>rostellum</i>” (“a small beak”),
on which the sticky bodies (<i>glandulæ</i>) arise; by aid of these the
heavy, connected pollen-masses may be glued to the insects which visit
the flower, and pollination is thus secured (in <i>Apostasieæ</i> and
<i>Cypripedileæ</i> the 3 carpels each contribute to the formation of
the stigma). The fruit is a <i>capsule</i> which most often dehisces
<i>by 6 valves</i>, 3 of which are broader and bear the placentæ, and 3
alternating with them are narrower and barren (except <i>Vanilla</i>).
The very numerous and exceedingly small seeds have <i>no endosperm</i>,
and have a somewhat <i>spherical embryo without any trace of external
organs</i>. The testa is membranous and loose.</p>

<p>The Orchids are <i>all perennial herbs</i> with diverse habits and
varying morphological structure (see the genera); the leaves are
scattered, of the usual Liliaceous form, and the inflorescences in
all cases are <i>racemes or spikes</i> (sometimes branched), with
subtending bracts, but without bracteoles.</p>

<p>The forms which are the least modified are described first.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">Apostasieæ.</span> The perianth-leaves are almost alike

modified stigma (rostellum), and is easily liberated from it (Fig.
<a href="#fig320">320</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>F</i>). The pollinium, which is formed in
an anther-loculus, together with its caudicle and adhesive disc, is
termed “pollinarium” (Fig. <a href="#fig320">320</a> <i>C</i>).&mdash;All Ophrydeæ are terrestrial
with <i>tuberous roots</i>, two of which are present in the flowering
period, an older one (from the preceding year) containing the
nourishment for the flowering-shoot of the year, and a young one which
is intended to contain the reserve material for the following year.

causing the labellum to be turned upwards), <i>Sturmia</i>
and <i>Corallorhiza</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> (Coral-root); the latter has a

are tropical epiphytes. <i>Stanhopea</i>, <i>Catasetum</i>,
<i>Maxillaria</i>, <i>Oncidium</i>, <i>Vanda</i>,
<i>Polystachya</i>, etc.</p>

<p>6,000 (10,000?) species. The majority live in the Tropics and
occur, especially, as epiphytes on trees or in the crevices
of rocks, to which they are attached by aerial roots. These
<i>aerial roots</i>, like those of Araceæ, are covered by
several layers of spirally-thickened cells (tracheides) which
contain air and form the velamen&mdash;an apparatus to absorb
moisture from the air. The roots have a white appearance when
the cells are filled with air, which changes to a greenish hue
when they are filled with water, the chlorophyll then shining
through. They generally have horizontal rhizomes; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> ascending
shoots, which bear the foliage-leaves, may vary, but they very
often swell and assume the form of a tuber, which persists for
several years fresh and green after the leaves have fallen off
(Fig. <a href="#fig321">321</a>). <i>Vanilla</i> is an exception (see above). Our
Orchids are all terrestrial (or marsh-plants); the largest
number of species is found in calcareous soils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination</span> takes place principally by means of
insects, but self-pollination occurs in some. The lip serves as
a landing-stage for the insect visitors, which, on sucking the
honey, cause the adhesive discs, with the pollinia attached to
them, to adhere to their bodies (generally to the probosces)
and so carry them away to other flowers. In some species parts
of the flower are sensitive or irritable, which has some
connection with the pollination. Without doubt there are a great
many biological differences which are closely connected with
the infinite multiplicity of forms; Darwin (1862) has already
shown an enormous variety, never even dreamt of before, in
the European species. The genus <i>Catasetum</i> has ♂-♀-and
☿-plants with flowers of such different appearances that
they have been classed in various genera (<i>Myanthus</i>,
<i>Monacanthus</i>). <i>Platanthera</i> is pollinated by
hawk-moths; <i>Ophrys</i>, by flies; <i>Epipactis latifolia</i>,
by wasps; <i>Orchis</i>, by bees, especially humble-bees, etc.</p>

the seeds being so exceedingly small and light. Many species

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span></p>


<h3>Class II. <b>Dicotyledones.</b></h3>

<p>In this class <span class="allsmcap">THE EMBRYO</span> has 2 seed-leaves, a rule from which
there are few exceptions (<i>e.g. Ficaria</i>, <i>Cyclamen</i>,
<i>Pinguicula</i>, certain species of <i>Corydalis</i>, with only
1; and a few, mostly parasitic forms, <i>e.g. Monotropa</i>,
<i>Orobanche</i>, <i>Pyrola</i>, entirely without cotyledons). On
germination the cotyledons nearly always raise themselves above the
ground as green, assimilating leaves and are then termed aerial or
epigean, in contradistinction to the underground or hypogean which
are always buried. The structure of the seed varies (endospermous
or exendospermous); the embryo may be straight or curved. In many
instances the primary root grows as a vigorous tap-root, with weaker
branches arising acropetally (in annuals, biennials, many perennials,
especially woody plants); but in a large number of herbaceous
perennials, which have rhizomes, the root behaves very much as in the
Monocotyledons. The roots generally increase in thickness by means of a
cambium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The stem</span>, when seen in transverse section, has its vascular
bundles arranged in a ring; in reality, however, they form a kind
of cylindrical network in the stem; the bundles are open, and
thickening takes place by means of a cambium; annual rings are formed
in the perennial stems. There is a rich and very varied form of
<i>branching</i>. The two first leaves of a shoot (fore-leaves) are
placed nearly always to the right and to the left; the same arrangement
is found in the two first leaves developed on the flower-stalk, and
these are, as a rule, the only two; they are found below the calyx and
are usually termed the “<i>bracteoles</i>.” It has become customary
to indicate the bracteoles by the letters α and β, according to their
sequence of growth, and in that sense these letters will be employed in
the following diagrams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The arrangement of the leaves</span> varies very much; there is
also a great variety of shapes in the leaves and their venation,
but the linear leaves, with parallel venation, so frequent in the
Monocotyledons, are seldom met with, as also the large sheaths (though
the sheath is well developed in the Umbelliferous plants); stipules
occur much more frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The flower</span> is most commonly cyclic, but acyclic or hemicyclic
forms also occur. The type which may be taken as a basis consists in
the majority of instances, as in the Monocotyledons, of 5 whorls, of
which the 4 outer ones (calyx, corolla, and the 2<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> whorls of stamens)
are most frequently 4 or 5 in number and placed in regular alternation,
whilst the innermost one (the carpels) has generally fewer members,
probably on account of space (Figs. <a href="#fig360">360</a>, <a href="#fig361">361</a>, <a href="#fig421">421</a>, <a href="#fig429">429</a>, <a href="#fig487">487</a>, etc.).
Trimerous (Figs. <a href="#fig384">384</a>, <a href="#fig387">387</a>, etc.) flowers, or those in which the members
of the flower are in threes or a multiple of three, also occur, as well
as dimerous flowers; other numbers are rare. It is of the greatest
importance in connection with the relative position of the members of
the flower to the axis and bract (orientation), whether the bracteoles
are typically present (even though they may not be developed), or
are typically absent. If there are 2 bracteoles present, then their
position in a pentamerous flower is often as follows: the first sepal
turns obliquely forward, the second is posterior and median, the
third obliquely forward, the fourth and fifth obliquely backward;
quincuncial æstivation is often found in these buds (Figs. <a href="#fig360">360</a>, <a href="#fig429">429</a>,
<a href="#fig471">471</a>, <a href="#fig475">475</a>, <a href="#fig584">584</a>). The first and third leaves, in the following chapters,
are most frequently alluded to as the “anterior,” the fourth and fifth
as the “lateral” leaves. The <i>reversed</i> arrangement, with the
median sepal in the front, occurs for instance in <i>Papilionaceæ</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig511">511</a>), <i>Lobeliaceæ</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig594">594</a>), <i>Rhodoracecæ</i>. If any
bracteoles are present below a tetramerous flower, the relation is
generally that 2 sepals (the first ones) stand in the median plane,
the two next ones transversely (Fig. <a href="#fig393">393</a>), and the corolla then adopts
a diagonal position (Fig. <a href="#fig397">397</a>); but a diagonal position of the calyx
generally shows that the flower is not, strictly speaking, tetramerous,
as in <i>Plantago</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig567">567</a>), <i>Veronica</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig599">559</a> <i>C</i>)
and others.</p>

<p>If the bracteoles are <i>not</i> typically present, then the position
of the sepals is changed accordingly, and the two outer sepals
endeavour to assume the position which the bracteoles would otherwise
have occupied, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Primula</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig547">547</a>). Other
positions are also found when the number of bracteoles is more or less
than two.</p>

<p>The leaves which follow the sepals occupy definite positions with
regard to them, which we may consider later. An arrangement must,
however, be mentioned here; when the flower is “<i>diplostemonous</i>”
that is, has two whorls of stamens (thus, Sn, Pn, An + n), these may be
arranged in two ways. <i>Either</i> the first-formed whorl of stamens,
which are termed the “calyx-stamens,” stands directly in front of the
sepals (that is “episepalous”), and is the <i>outermost</i> whorl,
and in this case a regular alternation takes place between sepals,
petals and the two whorls of stamens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> which is also continued into
the carpels if their number is the same as that of the other whorls:
the carpels are then placed opposite the sepals (Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>) and the
flower is <i>isomerous</i> and Gn should be added to the formula
above. <i>Or</i>, the calyx-stamens form the <i>innermost</i> whorl,
and the corolla-stamens, which are subsequently formed (“epipetalous”
stamens), stand <i>outside</i> these (Figs. <a href="#fig360">360</a>, <a href="#fig429">429</a>); if the number
of carpels is the same as that of the preceding whorls, they are often
placed <i>right in front</i> of the petals and the corolla-stamens.
The first-mentioned arrangement is termed <i>Diplostemonous</i>, and
the second <i>Obdiplostemonous</i>. <span class="smaller">Both arrangements may be found
in one and the same order, <i>e.g.</i> Caryophyllaceæ. The size and
relation of the members of the flowers, and also the contact with other
members in the early stages of their development, play an important
part in determining the arrangement.</span></p>

<p>The great number of structural arrangements found in this enormously
large class, may, as is the case in the Monocotyledons, be further
varied by <i>suppression and division</i> of certain leaves (especially
the stamens). Instances of this will occur in the following (Figs. <a href="#fig559">559</a>,
<a href="#fig568">568</a>.&mdash;<a href="#fig426">426</a>, <a href="#fig441">441</a>, <a href="#fig445">445</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>The Dicotyledons were formerly divided into 3 sub-classes: Apetalæ
(those without corolla), Sympetalæ or Gamopetalæ (those with the petals
united), and Choripetalæ or Polypetalæ (the petals not united). This
division has now been abandoned because it has been proved that the
Apetalæ were merely reduced or incomplete forms of the Choripetalæ, and
they have therefore been distributed among the various families of the
latter sub-class.</p>

<p>With regard to the Sympetalæ (or Gamopetalæ) it may be stated that
they form to a very great extent a closely connected and natural
group, having in common not only the character that the corolla is
gamopetalous and the stamens united with it (this being also found in
the Choripetalæ), but also a great many others (such as persistent
calyx, cyclic flowers with the formula S5, P5, A5 and as a rule G2,
the two carpels being united to form the ovary; seeds with a thick
integument and a very small nucellus). They are therefore considered
as an independent sub-class, and must be placed at the close of the
system of classification as the forms which presumably have arisen the
latest. In the future systems of classification this arrangement will
very probably be changed, and the first families of the Sympetalæ, the
Bicornes and others will for instance be to a certain extent united
with the families or orders of the Choripetalæ. The Sympetalæ may
certainly be considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> as the youngest types, the strongly pronounced
metamorphosis supporting this theory, as also the formation of the
integument of the ovule, the one thick integument being undoubtedly
derived from the coalescence of two&mdash;a holochlamydeous ovule, etc.</p>

<p>The Apetalæ and Choripetalæ are united into one sub-class. The leaves
of the perianth in this case are, as a rule, free from each other, the
structure of the flowers presents many differences, and the ovules have
as a rule 2 integuments and a large nucellus. Considerable uncertainty
still prevails regarding the arrangement and the relationship of the
individual families of the Choripetalæ, and some of the following
families are hardly quite natural; but the best arrangement arrived at
so far has been adopted here.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the book a review of the orders of the Dicotyledons
will be found.</p>

<h4>Family 1. <b>Salicifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>Trees and shrubs, which, in the structure of the vegetative shoot
and the catkin-like inflorescences, resemble the Quercifloræ, but
the structure of the flower differs so much from them, that the only
order brought under this heading&mdash;<i>Salicaceæ</i>&mdash;well deserves to
be separated and to form a family of its own, the nearest relatives
of which are still doubtful. <span class="smaller">As Juglandaceæ and Myricaceæ also
deserve to be placed in a special family, the name <i>Amentaceæ</i>
(<i>Catkin-bearers</i>), hitherto applied to all of these plants,

the ripening of the fruit (♀) (Fig. <a href="#fig322">322</a>). The perianth is very

united on the anterior side into a scale. The capsule opens by the
dorsal suture. The seed-hairs spring from the funicle.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> The Poplars are wind-pollinated. The
Willows have sticky pollen and are pollinated by insects. The
catkins of the Willows, especially the ♂, are more conspicuous,
from the numerous, closely-packed, yellow flowers, rich in honey
and pollen. The catkins often appear before the foliage and so
are much more easily seen, whilst at this time of the year the
number of competing honey-flowers is smaller, and the insect
visits consequently more numerous. On many catkins of the Willow
the flowers open earliest on the side which is turned towards
the sun and in descending order, <i>i.e.</i> the upper flowers
develop before the lower ones. Hybrids frequently appear.</p>

<p>There are about 180 species existing in the northern, cold and
temperate latitudes. Some in the Polar regions are scarcely more
than an inch in height, and have a creeping rhizome (<i>Salix
herbacea</i>, <i>polaris</i>, <i>reticulata</i>). Fossil
forms are found in the Tertiary and perhaps also in the Upper
Cretaceous.</p>

branches of many Willows are cultivated for basket-making,
etc. The wood of the Aspen is used for matches. The bark
contains tannin and, in many Willows, a very bitter extract,
<i>Salicin</i> (<i>S. pentandra</i>, <i>fragilis</i>). Salicylic
acid (officinal) is obtained from <i>Salix</i>. Balsam is
extracted from the buds of many Poplars, especially when the
leaves are shooting.</p>

<h4>Family 2. <b>Casuarinifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>Trees with verticillate, scale-like leaves forming sheaths at the
nodes. Monœcious. Flowers unisexual. ♂-flowers in catkins; ♀ in short
spikes. <i>Pollen-tube entering the ovule at the chalaza</i>, and not
through the micropyle. Ovary 1-seeded, unilocular. Carpels uniting into
a multiple fruit. Only one order.</p>

<p>Order. <b>Casuarinaceæ.</b> Trees (30 species), from Australia and
certain parts of S.E. Asia, with peculiar, equisetum-like appearance.
The leaves are verticillate, scale-like and united into sheaths. The
internodes are furrowed. Branching verticillate. The unisexual flowers
are situated in catkins or short spikes. The ♂-flower has a central
stamen, surrounded by 2 median, scale-like perianth-leaves and 2
lateral bracteoles. The ♀-flower has a 1-chambered ovary (2 ascending,
orthotropous ovules), no perianth, but 2 large, lateral bracteoles
which finally become woody and form two valves, between which the
nut-like fruit is situated. The multiple-fruits therefore resemble
small cones.&mdash;<i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>, cultivated, gives
“iron-wood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The Casuarinas differ from the ordinary Dicotyledons in many
important respects which may be briefly summarised thus:&mdash;The
bicarpellate ♀-flower has a well-pronounced stylar-cylinder
terminated by two stigmas, but the cavity of the ovary closes
very soon after its formation, and in it are developed two
parietal ovules; these are united by a bridge of cellulose to
the stylar-cylinder or summit of the ovary, and hence the ovules
are connected with the walls of the ovary by the bridge (above),
as well as by the funicle (below). The archespore is developed
from the hypodermal cells at the summit of the nucellus,
two primordial mother-cells are first formed and from these
by tangential divisions a central cylindrical mass of cells
(sporogenous-tissue) is produced which is surrounded by tapetal
cells. The cells of the sporogenous tissue correspond to the
mother-cells of the embryo-sac of other Angiosperms; they divide
transversely and from 16–20 macrospores are formed together with
inactive cells which are not crushed together as in the case
of other Phanerogams. The sexual apparatus is developed from a
single cell, but the number of cells composing this apparatus
is subject to variation, the oosphere being accompanied by one
or two neighbouring cells which resemble canal-cells rather
than synergidæ. The sexual apparatus is found in the majority
of the macrospores, but in most of these it remains as a number
of naked cells; while in the fertile macrospores the cells
are invested by walls of cellulose (usually only one fertile
macrospore is found in each ovule). Antipodal cells are never
developed. The macrospores elongate considerably towards the
chalaza, into which some penetrate. The pollen-tube traverses
the stylar-cylinder and enters the ovules at the chalaza, its
passage through the tissue of the nucellus being assisted by
the prolongation of the macrospores. About the centre of the
nucellus the pollen-tube is ruptured; the apical portion which
alone takes part in the fertilisation being firmly attached to
the macrospore. Although the actual impregnation has not been
observed, Treub considers that the endosperm begins to be formed
before fertilisation.]</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 3. <b>Quercifloræ.</b></h4>

<p><i>Trees</i> and <i>shrubs</i> with small, unisexual, <i>monœcious</i>
flowers, having no perianth or a simple inconspicuous one. The ♂
and ♀ flowers are very different and generally placed in separate
inflorescences. The ♂-flowers are most often adnate to the bracts.
The stamens are placed <i>opposite the perianth-leaves</i>, when
they are present in equal numbers. The ♀-flower is <i>naked</i>,
or has a <i>superior</i> perianth. The ovary at the base is 2- or
3-(-6) locular with 1 or 2 pendulous ovules in each loculus, only
one of which is developed; the fruit is a one-seeded <i>nut</i>;
<i>endosperm absent</i>; embryo straight. The inflorescences, which
are either compound and mixed (small dichasia in spikes) or simple,
are here also termed <i>catkins</i>; but, strictly speaking, this
term is applied to the ♂-inflorescences only. In all Quercifloræ the

<p>It is worthy of remark that in <i>Betulaceæ</i>,
<i>Corylaceæ</i> and <i>Quercus</i> the ovules, and to some
extent the loculi of the ovary are not developed till after
pollination, so that the development of the pollen-tube proceeds
very slowly. The smallness of the flowers, the absence of
honey, the dryness and lightness of the pollen, the size of the
stigma and the abundance of hairs found on many stigmas are all
adaptations for wind-pollination. It is also an advantage that
the flowers are generally pollinated before the foliage-leaves
are developed, thus preventing the pollen being entangled by the
leaves.</p>

<p>The two orders <i>Betulaceæ</i> and <i>Corylaceæ</i> mentioned
here are by other authors united into one order. [It is doubtful
whether these two should be retained in the family Quercifloræ,
as recent researches (p. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>) have shown that they differ from
the Cupuliferæ in many important points, and agree with the
Casuarinas in the fact that the pollen-tube enters the ovule
through the chalaza.]</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Betulaceæ</b> (<b>Birches</b>). Monœcious, with thick,
cylindrical, <i>compound</i> ♂ and ♀ inflorescences (2- or 3-flowered
dichasia in a spike with spirally-placed floral-leaves) (Figs. <a href="#fig324">324</a>,
<a href="#fig326">326</a>, <a href="#fig328">328</a>). When the perianth in the ♂-flower is completely developed,
it is composed of 4 somewhat united leaves, which are placed
opposite the 4 stamens (Figs. <a href="#fig325">325</a>, <a href="#fig326">326</a> <i>A</i>). The female flowers
are <i>naked</i>; the ovary is bilocular, with two styles and one
<i>pendulous</i> ovule in each loculus. The subtending floral-leaves
unite with the bracteoles and form a 3–5-lobed cover-scale, which is
not attached to the fruit (Figs. <a href="#fig325">325</a> <i>D</i>, <a href="#fig326">326</a> <i>B</i>). Fruit a
<i>nut without cupule</i> (see <i>Corylaceæ</i> and <i>Cupuliferæ</i>).
<span class="smaller">In the bud the leaves are flat. The stipules are deciduous. On
germination the cotyledons are raised above the ground. Terminal buds
are only found on old Alder trees; the Birch has sympodial branches.</span></p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Corylaceæ</b> (<b>Hazel-nuts</b>). Monœcious. The ♂-catkins

a 2-flowered dichasium (Fig. <a href="#fig329">329</a> <i>D</i>) is present, of which the
central flower (* in Fig. <a href="#fig330">330</a> <i>B</i>) is suppressed. The gynœceum
is bicarpellary as in the Birches; the ovary is bilocular, with two
long styles (Fig. <a href="#fig329">329</a> <i>D-F</i>); the loculi have 1 (-2) ovules (Fig.
<a href="#fig330">330</a> <i>B</i>). Each single ♀-flower and fruit is surrounded by a
<i>leaf-like covering</i>, the <i>cupule</i> (husk), which is <i>formed
of three floral-leaves</i> (namely, the bract of a lateral flower,
and its own bracteoles; thus in Fig. <a href="#fig330">330</a> <i>B</i>, α, α′, β’ form the

♀-catkins are enclosed in buds, in which they pass the winter; these
buds are situated in the axils of the fallen foliage-leaves, and it
is only by their larger size that they may be distinguished from the
ordinary foliage-buds. In spring the ♀-catkins are easily recognised
by their red, projecting stigmas (Fig. <a href="#fig329">329</a> <i>A</i>). The cupule&mdash;the
“husk”&mdash;is tubular, fringed, and envelopes the nut. <span class="smaller">The leaves
are alternate and unsymmetrical, the external side being larger than
the internal; this is connected with the vernation, the blade being

them which is suppressed in the external ones. The cotyledons remain
underground on germination.</span></p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Cupuliferæ.</b> Monœcious. The inflorescences make their
appearance with the leaves, arising in the axils of the leaves of the
same year. <i>A woody cupule</i> furnished externally with scales or
spines is <i>common</i>, and surrounds 1-several flowers (the cupule
in the Corylaceæ never encloses more than a <i>single</i> flower or
fruit). The ♂-flower has a united perianth, which is, however, 4–6
partite, and encloses an indefinite number of undivided stamens. The
♀-flower has a <i>superior, 6-merous</i> perianth (3 + 3, compare Figs.
<a href="#fig332">332</a> <i>D</i>, <a href="#fig334">334</a>); the gynœceum is formed of 3 (or in <i>Castanea</i>
4–6) carpels with a corresponding number of stigmas (Figs. <a href="#fig332">332</a>
<i>D</i>, <i>H</i>; <a href="#fig334">334</a>, <a href="#fig335">335</a>); and the ovary has at the base 3 (-6)
loculi (Fig. <a href="#fig333">333</a>), each of which has 2 pendulous anatropous ovules; the
fruit is a one-seeded nut (Figs. <a href="#fig332">332</a> <i>H</i>, <a href="#fig336">336</a>).</p>

<p>The cupule of the Cupuliferæ, according to the opinion of Eichler, is
formed by united bracteoles, (compare Fig. <a href="#fig333">333</a>, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> the four valves
in the cupule of Castanea are considered as bracteoles of the lateral
flowers of the dichasium); according to another view (see Prantl, in
Engler’s <i>Bot. Jahrb.</i>, viii., 1889), it is a ring-like axial
outgrowth independent of the bracteoles of the flower, whose scales
and spines are floral-leaves. The cupule in the Oak only encloses the
base of the fruit, but in the Eating-chestnut and Beech the fruit is
completely enclosed, and consequently the cupule must divide into a
number of valves (generally 4) to allow the fruit to escape. In the
3-flowered dichasia of <i>Pasania</i>, Sect. Eupasania (Trop. Ind.),
each individual flower has its own cupule of the same structure and
development as in <i>Quercus</i>; and, moreover, each group of flowers
has externally the typical six bracteoles.</p>

The Beech has one species, <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, in Europe; it is
a most important forest tree (in Denmark the most important) and
reaches its most northern limit near Alvesund in Norway (60° N.L.),
its northern boundary line passing from Alvesund in a zig-zag line
through Ludwigsort, south of Königsberg, in Prussia, towards the
Crimea. According to Steenstrup and Vaupell, the Beech did not make
its appearance in Denmark until a comparatively recent time, the Oak
then being partially supplanted. Other species of Beech are found
in N. America and Japan. Several species of <i>Nothofagus</i> occur
in the South West of S. America, and in the colder regions of the
southern hemisphere. The Oaks grow especially in temperate regions,

<h4>Family 4. <b>Juglandifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>This family resembles the Quercifloræ in the catkin-like
inflorescences, the imperfect, <i>unisexual</i> flowers, the epigynous
perianth and the woody shoots with scattered leaves, etc., though
it is in other respects very dissimilar; one point of difference
is the presence of <i>aromatic</i> compounds, but a more important
divergence is found in the structure of the gynœceum, which is formed
of two carpels with <i>one loculus</i> and has one <i>basal</i>,
<i>orthotropous and erect</i> ovule, which, as in the Quercifloræ, does
not become developed until after pollination; the fruit too is very
different, being generally a <i>drupe</i>. <i>Endosperm absent.</i></p>

frequently <i>unilocular</i>, with one ovule (Fig. <a href="#fig340">340</a>). The fruit
is a <i>nut</i>, more rarely a drupe, with one seed, <i>generally
endospermous</i>. <span class="smaller">The Nettles are the sole order in the family
which has only one carpel (1 stigma); this turns the posterior side

the anterior only is fertile (Fig. <a href="#fig346">346</a>) except in a few Ulmaceæ and
Moraceæ.</span></p>

<p>The majority are trees or shrubs with petiolated leaves,
<i>stipulate</i>; <i>rough hairs</i> are very frequently developed
upon the leaves. The flowers are very often crowded together in the
inflorescence, which is rarely catkin-like. Peculiar aggregations of
fruits are found in some orders. <i>Latex</i> and tough <i>bast</i>,

<p>Order 1. <b>Ulmaceæ</b> (<b>Elms</b>).&mdash;Trees or shrubs without latex.
Leaves simple, arranged in two rows (divergence 1/2), oblique (the
inner side, nearer the axis, being the larger), strongly penninerved,
dentate, hispid; stipules deciduous. In opposition to the other
Nettle-like plants the flowers are often ☿ with a united cup- or
saucer-like, generally 4–(5)–6-divided perianth, and a corresponding
or larger number of opposite <i>erect</i> stamens. The gynœceum has
two carpels (2 stigmas), generally one loculus with one pendulous,
anatropous or amphitropous ovule,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> seldom two loculi and 2 ovules.

which are united into catkin-like inflorescences. The perianth is
composed very often of 4 (2 + 2) free, or in the ♀-flowers generally
united, green leaves; the 4 (2 + 2) stamens are opposite the
perianth-leaves, the filaments are <i>bent inwards</i> in the bud
and throw themselves elastically towards the outside. The gynœceum
has <i>one style</i> and <i>one stigma</i> (capitate or brush-like,

brittle apex, which breaks off in an oblique direction and allows the
poisonous cell-sap to be forced out. In many tropical Nettles this is
so strong that it may produce partial paralysis. There is no rudiment
of an ovary in the ♂-flowers (Fig. <a href="#fig340">340</a> A). The <span class="allsmcap">PERIANTH</span> in the

it often happens that all the perianth-leaves are united to form a
gamophyllous envelope. ☿-flowers may occur among the others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
inflorescences</span> among our native species are dichasia, which become
transformed into unilateral scorpioid cymes by the development of the
bud of the 2nd bracteole. In <i>Parietaria</i> they are more pressed
together, and the floral-leaves at the same time are also raised on
their axillary shoots to just beneath the flower. As a rule, not only
in this order but also in those related to it, a small vegetative
branch is situated in the axil of the foliage-leaf, and this bears an
inflorescence on each side at its base.</span></p>

Monœcious. The inflorescences are catkin-like in appearance, but in
reality composed of many small dichasia. The flowers are similar to
those of the Nettle, but with 2 carpels: in the ♂ with perianth 2 + 2,
and stamens 2 + 2 (Fig. <a href="#fig342">342</a>), in the ♀, perianth 2 + 2, and 2 carpels
in regular alternation. The small drupes are enveloped by <i>the
perianth, which eventually becomes fleshy</i>, and as all the flowers
on the axis very accurately fit together, the collection of fruits is
formed, which we call a Mulberry (Fig. <a href="#fig344">344</a>). The leaves are folded

(ocrea) formed in the axil of each leaf by the connate stipules, covers
the younger leaves as a hood. It falls off as the leaf expands, and
leaves a ring-like scar on the stem.&mdash;<i>Ficus</i> (the Fig). The
inflorescence (the so-called syconus) has a pear-shaped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span> fleshy, but
hollow axis, on the interior surface of which the flowers are situated
(Fig. <a href="#fig345">345</a>). It is a kind of capitulum, with a hollow receptacle,
whose “involucral” leaves close over the entrance to the interior;
it is not, however, a simple capitulum, but a coalescence of cymose
inflorescences. The edible parts are the fleshy stem-portion and
perianth-leaves. The ♂-flower has a 2–6 divided perianth, 1–2 (–6)
stamens; the ♀-flower has an oblique ovary. The fruits are drupes,
with thin flesh.&mdash;<span class="smaller">Many species have aerial roots, and some live
as epiphytes on trees. <span class="smcap">Pollination</span>, in the edible Fig, is
effected by a small Gall-wasp (<i>Cynips psenes</i> L.), which lays
its eggs in the Fig, and hence carries the pollen away. Even in very
ancient times it was customary to hang infected wild Figs on the
branches of cultivated ones, so that the young Gall-wasps, as they
emerged, could immediately effect the pollination (caprification).
<i>Ficus carica</i>, and other species, have two kinds of ♀-flowers,
besides the ♂-flowers. One kind has a short style and no stigmatic
hairs, and it is only in the ovaries of these that the wasps lay their
eggs (gall-flowers); the other kind has a long style and well-developed
stigmatic-hairs, but the wasps cannot reach their ovaries&mdash;these are
“seed-flowers.” There are, moreover, two kinds of plants of <i>Ficus
carica</i>; ♀-plants, which have only seed-flowers, and bear the edible
Figs, and ♂-plants (called “Caprificus”), which bear inedible fruits,
and have ♂-flowers at the upper part of the Fig, but gall-flowers at
the base. [The Caprificus, at Naples, bears three crops of inedible
Figs each year, viz. <i>Mamme</i> (April), <i>Profichi</i> (June),
<i>Mamnoni</i> (August). The ♂-flowers are produced especially in
June, the first Figs being almost entirely ♀, and the last having but
few ♂-flowers. Each crop produces a new generation of Fig-wasps. The
female wasp enters the Figs on the Caprificus, and lays one egg in
each flower, with the result that the flower developes into a kind of
gall. The mother-wasp dies within the Fig. The male wasp is wingless;
it bites a small passage into the ovaries containing the female wasps,
and impregnates them; the female wasps then escape from the Fig, those
in the <i>Profichi</i> carrying pollen away with them as they pass
out. They then enter another Fig, lay their eggs, and die. The edible
Fig-tree similarly has three crops in the year, <i>Fiori di fico</i>,
<i>Pedagnuoli</i>, <i>Cimaruoli</i>. The wasps, entering these Figs,
are unable to lay their eggs in the ovary, but, nevertheless, they
effect cross-pollination on entering the <i>Pedagnuoli</i>, which bear
fertile seeds.]</span></p>

used for the officinal Mulberry juice. The ordinary Fig-tree

of the well-known Oriental Sycamore (<i>F. sycomorus</i>) is
edible. The Bread-fruit tree (<i>Artocarpus incisa</i>) and
the Jack (<i>A. integrifolia</i>) have their home in the South
Sea Islands, and are cultivated in tropical countries. The
Bread-fruit is morphologically the same as the Mulberry. It
has a very large, spheroid inflorescence, whose floral-leaves
and perianth become fleshy and united into one nutritious
mass, together with the axis, which is also fleshy. The milky
juice of the India-rubber tree (<i>Ficus elastica</i>, East
Indies, a common house-plant), and of <i>Castilloa elastica</i>
(Am.) is the raw material of India-rubber. The milky juice of
<i>Galactodendron utile</i> (Cow-tree, S. Am.) is saccharine and
nutritious, but in <i>Antiaris toxicaria</i> (the Upas-tree,
of Java) it is a strong poison. The bast of the Paper-Mulberry

<p>Only 2 genera with 3 species (Asiatic), of which two are
cultivated.&mdash;<i>Humulus lupulus</i> (Hop, Figs. <a href="#fig347">347–349</a>) is a twining,
perennial plant, twisting to the right, with opposite, palmilobed,
rough leaves, and large, interpetiolar stipules. The ♀-flowers are
situated in closely-flowered, cone-like, compound inflorescences, with
ultimately large, thin, imbricate floral-leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig348">348</a>) which bear
the yellow, glandular hairs, containing lupulin. <span class="smaller">This inflorescence
is made up as follows:&mdash;The most external floral-leaves are situated in
pairs, and are the persistent stipules of a leaf, the blade of which
has become suppressed, or in any case is rudimentary. Such a pair of
stipules supports 4 (2–6) flowers in a double uniparous cyme, whose
central axis does not develope into a flower. The bracts of these
flowers (bracteoles of the partial inflorescence) become, at maturity,
very large, spathe-like, and, together with the stipules, produce a
cone-like appearance.</span></p>

<p><i>Cannabis sativa</i> (Hemp, Figs. <a href="#fig350">350–353</a>) is an East Indian herb,
with palmilobed leaves, and differs from the Hop in being annual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
erect, and in having its leaves opposite at the base and scattered
above. The ♀-inflorescence is not cone-like as in the Hop, but the
flowers are similar in construction. <span class="smaller">The main difference is to be
found in the axillary shoot, which was suppressed in the Hop, and is in
the Hemp developed into a leaf-bearing shoot which on each side bears
only one ♀-flower, and in the fact that the bracts are not so strongly
developed.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The “Hops” (the female inflorescences) are used in brewing,
and medicinally on account of the yellow glands which contain
lupulin. The Indian variety of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> contains
an abundance of glandular hairs and resin. The withered
inflorescences are used in medicine and are officinal. The bast
of the stems of the Hemp is also used and the fat oil of the
seeds. In Oriental countries the entire plant is used in the
preparation of an intoxicating drink (haschisch), the narcotic
material being found in the glandular hairs.</p>

<h4>Family 6. <b>Polygonifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>This family is on one side closely allied to the <i>Urticaceæ</i>
by its solitary, <i>basal</i>, <i>vertical</i>, and <i>straight</i>
ovule, and by the conical ocrea which envelopes the younger leaves
in the bud, similar characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> being present in the Urticaceæ. On
the other side it is related to the Curvembryæ. The flowers are
small, often <i>trimerous</i>, regular and slightly perigynous (<span class="smaller">in
<i>Chloranthaceæ</i>, if they properly belong to this family, and
<i>Houttuynia</i>, more or less epigynous</span>). Syncarps are present in
some Piperaceæ, but the fruit is generally a single fruit, one-seeded
berry, nut or drupe. The leaves are generally scattered.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Polygonaceæ.</b> The majority are herbaceous plants with
round, often jointed stems, scattered leaves and <i>ocrea</i>, that
is a membranous, tubular, ligular or stipular structure <i>inside</i>
the base of the leaf, which clasps the stem and axillary bud; the
edges of the lamina are rolled backwards in the bud. The flowers are
regular, small, generally ☿, slightly perigynous, with inconspicuous,
simple, green or white perianth of 5–6 free segments; stamens 5–9 (Fig.
<a href="#fig354">354</a>) sometimes arranged in two series; gynœceum 2–3 carpels, ovary
<i>unilocular</i> with <i>one basal</i>, <i>straight</i> (orthotropous)
<i>ovule</i>, 2–3 <i>free styles</i>. The fruit is a 2–3-angular nut;
the embryo, with mealy endosperm, is straight or curved (Fig. <a href="#fig355">355</a>
<i>H</i>), often unsymmetrical.&mdash;<span class="smaller">The inflorescences are compound,
and generally branch from the axils of the bracteoles, so that the last
partial-inflorescences become coiled, uniparous scorpioid cymes; in
<i>Polygonum</i> the two bracteoles unite into a membranous tube; in
<i>Rheum</i> and <i>Rumex</i> there is only one bracteole.</span></p>

  </div>

<p><i>Rheum</i> (Rhubarb, Fig. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>A</i>) has a 6-leaved,
<i>petaloid</i> perianth (Pn 3 + 3) and 9 stamens (A 3<sup>2</sup> + 3). The
<i>3-winged</i> nut is <i>not</i> enclosed by the perianth.</p>

<p><i>Rumex</i> (Dock, Fig. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>B</i>) has 6 stamens (A 3<sup>2</sup> + 0); the
perianth is 6-leaved (Pr 3 + 3), green or red, and the triangular nut
is enveloped by the 3 interior perianth-leaves, which point upwards
and continue to grow after flowering. These perianth-leaves often have
warts on their outer surface. <span class="smaller">The following are monœcious: <i>R.
acetosa</i> and <i>R. acetosella</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Polygonum</i> (Knot-grass, Figs. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>; 355). The
<i>petaloid</i> perianth is most frequently 5-merous (2/5 spiral); 5–8
stamens. The nut is triangular (Fig. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>C</i>, 355), or lenticular
(Fig. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>D</i>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> <span class="smaller">There are two whorls of stamens, the external
with introrse, and the internal with extrorse anthers. The gynœceum is
often bicarpellate (Fig. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>D</i>).</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The flowers may be considered as constructed upon the
monocotyledonous type. <i>Pterostegia</i> has a perfectly
monocotyledonous flower with 5 trimerous whorls. <i>Rheum</i>
likewise, but here the external staminal whorl is doubled (Fig.
<a href="#fig254">254</a> <i>A</i>). <i>Oxyria</i> has a dimerous <i>Rheum</i>-flower
(4-leaved perianth, 6 stamens, 2 stigmas). <i>Rumex</i> has a
<i>Rheum</i>-flower with the suppression of the internal whorl
of stamens (Fig. <a href="#fig354">354</a> <i>B</i>); <i>Emex</i> is a dimerous
<i>Rumex</i>. <i>Polygonum</i>, to which <i>Coccoloba</i>,
<i>Muehlenbeckia</i> and others are related, differs from
<i>Rheum</i> chiefly in having one of the leaves, which in the
latter takes part in the formation of the perianth, developed
in this case into a bracteole (so that the perianth is reduced
to five members), and several or all the stamens in the inner
whorl become suppressed.&mdash;The perianth in <i>Coccoloba</i> and
<i>Muehlenbeckia</i> is more or less perigynous and becomes
fleshy, enclosing the fruit. <i>Muehlenbeckia platyclada</i> has
flat branches with rudimentary leaves; sometimes branches with
normal, arrow-shaped leaves are found. <i>Atraphaxis.</i></p>

<i>Coccoloba</i>, <i>Triplaris</i>. <i>Rheum</i> is Central
Asiatic.&mdash;The thick rhizomes of <i>R. officinale</i>
(<i>Rhubarb</i>) are <i>officinal</i>. The rhizomes of the
ordinarily cultivated species, <i>R. undulatum</i> and

to 2, and the carpels to 1</span>. The flowers are situated in the axils
of the small, generally shield-like floral-leaves. The ovary is always
<i>unilocular</i> and has <i>one upright, orthotropous</i> ovule. Fruit
a berry or drupe. Both endosperm and <i>perisperm</i> are present, the
latter being especially well developed (Fig. <a href="#fig359">359</a>).</p>

<p><i>Piper</i>; generally shrubs with scattered leaves, and terminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>

of <i>Piper nigrum</i> (climbing shrub, East Indian); “Cubeb”
berries of <i>P. cubeba</i> (climbing shrub, Java). “Long-pepper”

</div>


<h4>Family 7. <b>Curvembryæ.</b></h4>

<p>The plants in this family have a <i>curved ovule</i>, and most
frequently a <i>kidney-shaped seed</i> (generally provided with fine,
cuticular, projecting warts, Fig. <a href="#fig362">362</a> <i>B</i>), with a <i>curved,
peripheral embryo enclosing the endosperm which is most frequently
floury</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig362">362</a> <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig365">365</a> <i>H</i>; for exceptions, see Fig.
<a href="#fig366">366</a>); the seeds in all cases are borne on a <i>centrally-placed</i>,
and in most cases <i>free</i>, placenta (they are “basal” when there
is only 1 ovule in the ovary, Fig. <a href="#fig364">364</a>). The flower is regular,
hypogynous or perigynous (Fig. <a href="#fig364">364</a>) (only rarely epigynous) and
usually 5-<i>merous</i>. The flower which is most complete has 5
whorls (S5, P5, A5+5, G2-3–5), as in some genera of the Caryophyllaceæ
(Figs. <a href="#fig360">360</a>, <a href="#fig361">361</a>); but from this type it becomes reduced, the petals
and stamens being suppressed, so that finally 5 perianth-leaves,
5 stamens (opposite the perianth-leaves), and 2 carpels (Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a>
<i>F</i>) only are present; for example,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span> in certain genera of the
<i>Caryophyllaceæ</i>, in the <i>Chenopodiaceæ</i>, <i>Amarantaceæ</i>,
and others. When the number of stamens is increased to more than 5
in the whorl, it is always possible to show that some of the stamens
have been divided. The number of the carpels and ovules also becomes
reduced; in the highest there is a central placenta, not free in its
early stages, with a large number of ovules; in those which are most
reduced there is only a single ovule, which is placed centrally at
the base of the ovary [Fig. <a href="#fig364">364</a>]. Somewhat corresponding changes are
found in the fruit, which is a many-seeded <i>capsule</i> in those
which have many ovules, but a one-seeded <i>nut</i> where there
is one ovule. In the most reduced forms the flowers are generally
unisexual.&mdash;Similar features are also present in the vegetative parts.
Almost all the species are herbaceous, the leaves are simple and most
frequently without stipules. <span class="smaller">The structure of the stem, especially
in Chenopodiaceæ, Amarantaceæ, Nyctaginiaceæ and others, often differs
from that of the ordinary Dicotyledon. In the woody portion of the stem
and root several rings are sometimes formed which resemble annual rings
but which are formed by new cambium-rings arising outside the old ones
which then cease to divide.</span></p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Caryophyllaceæ.</b> Herbaceous plants, with round, nodose
stem; leaves <i>opposite</i>, slightly amplexicaul, simple, with
sessile, undivided, entire lamina; stipules nearly always absent;
the inflorescences are <i>dichasia</i> passing over into unipared
scorpioid cymes. The flowers are regular, ☿ or unisexual, hypogynous or
perigynous, 5-(or 4-) merous with 2–3–4–5 carpels; calyx persistent;
corolla polypetalous. The ovary is unilocular (or originally, and
sometimes also in the later stages, plurilocular below, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Viscaria</i>), with <i>free styles</i> and 1–several curved ovules
on a <i>central</i>, free placenta. The fruit is a nut or a capsule
opening apically with long or short valves (teeth, Fig. <a href="#fig362">362</a>), equal
to or double the carpels. For the seeds refer to the family. <span class="smaller">In
<i>Dianthus</i> the embryo is straight.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The flowers which are most complete have <i>Sn</i>, <i>Pn</i>,
<i>An</i> + <i>n</i> (obdiplostemonous), <i>Gn</i> where
<i>n</i> = 5 (Figs. <a href="#fig360">360</a>, <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>A</i>) or 4 (Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>B</i>);
the carpels may be placed opposite to the sepals (Fig. <a href="#fig360">360</a>) or
opposite to the petals (Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>). Without
any change taking place in the position of the other whorls, the
carpels are next found reduced to 2–3–4 (see the genera); their
number may easily be recognised by that of the styles. This is
the construction in the majority of the genera in the two first
groups. <i>Stellaria media</i> differs considerably. It may
have (<i>a</i>) the flower as described above, with <i>G3</i>;
(<i>b</i>), the corolla only absent, or (<i>c</i>) only the
petal-stamens (A5 + 0, Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>C</i>), or (<i>d</i>) all
these as well as some of the sepal-stamens. The same applies
to <i>Sagina</i>, <i>Alsine</i>, <i>Cerastium</i>, and others,
and, finally, a series of genera are formed, with certain
conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span> of reduction which have become constant, and by a
gradual series of steps lead to the most reduced form, which has
only 5 sepals and 5 (or even as far as only 1) sepal-stamens
(Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>).&mdash;The <span class="allsmcap">PETALS</span>
in the <i>Alsineæ</i> are often deeply bifid. The sepal-stamens
are most frequently the longest, and bear nectaries at the base
(Fig. <a href="#fig363">363</a> <i>st</i>). In the most complete forms the ovary has
partition-walls in the lower portion (Fig. <a href="#fig360">360</a>); these do not,
however, reach to the top, and generally soon disappear. The
ovules, when numerous, are situated on the placenta in as many
double rows as there are carpels. In the number of ovules a
reduction from many to 1 takes place (Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a>). A comparison
proves that the “free, centrally placed” placenta is formed by
the ventral portion of the carpels. The single basal ovule in
<i>Herniaria</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig364">364</a>), <i>Scleranthus</i>, and others, is
also borne on the carpels.</p>

<p>The vegetative <i>branching</i> is characteristic. One of
the leaves in a pair is formed before the other, and has a
more vigorous axillary bud; these stronger leaves stand in a
¼-spiral, the fifth above the first one, and the branches are
consequently arranged in the same manner. In the inflorescence,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> <i>Alsineæ</i> has ordinary nectaries at
the base of the calyx-stamens (Fig. <a href="#fig336">336</a>): they are frequently
protandrous but may often, in the absence of cross-pollination
(in the less conspicuous species) pollinate themselves.
Their open flowers are accessible to many kinds of insects
(particularly flies and bees). <i>Gynodiœcious</i> flowers are
found in several species, and the ☿-flowers are then generally
more conspicuous than the ♀-flowers. That the ♀-flowers have
descended from ☿-flowers is seen by the large staminodes found
in them (Fig. <a href="#fig363">363</a>). <i>Arenaria peploides</i> is diœcious (Fig.
<a href="#fig363">363</a>). The <i>Sileneæ</i> are as a rule adapted for pollination
by insects with long probosces&mdash;especially butterflies,&mdash;and
they are frequently protandrous, so that at first the
calyx-stamens open, later on the corolla-stamens, then the
stigmas expand. The honey is secreted by a ring-like nectary
round the base of the ovary or by nectaries at the base of
the stamens. Some only blossom and emit scent at night or in
the evening (<i>Lychnis vespertina</i>, <i>Silene nutans</i>,
<i>Saponaria officinalis</i>) and, like other night-flowers, are
of a white or pale colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distribution.</span> 1,100 species, especially in temperate

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> “Soap-root” (with <i>Saponin</i>, forming
a lather in water) from <i>Saponaria officinalis</i> was
formerly officinal, and <i>Gypsophila struthium</i>. The seeds
of <i>Agrostemma githago</i> are said to be poisonous.&mdash;The
following are ornamental plants: species of Pinks (<i>D.
caryophyllus</i>, garden Pink, often with double flowers; <i>D.
barbatus</i>, <i>plumarius</i>, <i>etc.</i>). <i>Lychnis</i>,

tomentosum</i> as edging for borders), <i>Saponaria
officinalis</i> (often coronate).&mdash;<i>Spergula arvensis</i> is
sometimes cultivated.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Amarantaceæ.</b> The flowers are essentially
the same as in the <i>Chenopodiaceæ</i> and the extremely
reduced Caryophyllaceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>F</i>); they are regular,
hypogynous, generally ☿, have 5 free (rarely slightly united)
perianth-leaves; in front of these 5 stamens, which <i>are often
united</i> at their base into a shorter or longer tube and have
stipule-like teeth between them (the division <i>Gomphreneæ</i>
has 2-locular anthers, each of which opens longitudinally); and
a 2–3 carpellate gynœceum with one loculus and most frequently
one, more rarely several ovules; the fruit is a nut, more
rarely (in <i>Celosia</i>, <i>Amarantus</i>, <i>Gomphrena</i>)
a capsule, dehiscing irregularly, or like a pyxidium. The
characters which especially separate them from the allied orders
are found in the perianth. The perianth-leaves are not green and
herbaceous, but <i>membranous, dry, and often coloured</i>; they
are frequently produced into a bristle or awn; they have also
both subtending floral-leaves and <i>2 large bracteoles similar
to the perianth</i>; all these dry leaves persist without
alteration after the withering of the flower.&mdash;The flowers are
without scent. They are arranged in spike- or capitulum-like
inflorescences; sometimes placed singly, sometimes aggregated
in the panicle-like inflorescences; in others, on the contrary,
in dichasia. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> majority are herbs, some are shrubs. The
leaves are scattered, or opposite, but always simple and without
stipules; some are smooth, others hairy.</p>

<p>450 species; especially in the Tropics, principally S. Am. and
E. Ind.: few are found outside these countries.&mdash;Only a few
are used; some, chiefly E. Indian species, are cultivated as
ornamental plants: <i>Amaranthus</i> (Fox-tail); <i>Gomphrena
globosa</i>; <i>Celosia cristata</i> (Cock’s-comb) remarkable
for its fasciated inflorescence; <i>Alternanthera</i>. Some are
employed as culinary plants in the Tropics, and in a few of the
E. Indian species the seeds are farinaceous, and used for food.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Chenopodiaceæ.</b> Generally herbaceous plants like
the Caryophyllaceæ, but the leaves are arranged spirally (except
<i>Salicornia</i>), and are simple, exstipulate; they are generally
fleshy and like the stem “mealy,” that is, covered with small hairs,
whose large spherical terminal cell readily falls away; otherwise they
are seldom hairy. The inflorescences are generally flower-clusters
borne in panicles. Bracteoles generally absent. Flowers generally
<i>unisexual</i>: with the single exception of <i>Beta</i> the
flowers are hypogynous; they are regular, small and inconspicuous,
with <i>single, green</i>, 5-leaved, but <i>more or less united</i>
perianth; 5 stamens opposite the perianth, and a <i>2–5-carpellate,
unilocular</i> ovary with 1 basal, curved ovule; but in some genera the
number of the perianth-leaves and stamens is reduced to 3–2–1–0. The
fruit is generally a <i>nut</i>,&mdash;thus this flower and fruit are the
same as in the reduced Caryophyllaceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>F</i>). The seed is
similar to that generally found in the family (for exceptions see the
genera).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The floral diagram most frequently present is the same as
in Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>F</i>. There is no indication of corolla or
of corolla-stamens, which may be supposed to have belonged
to the plant, but which are now entirely and completely
suppressed. This order appears to have been an offshoot from
the Caryophyllaceæ.&mdash;The perianth persists after the withering
of the flower, and envelopes the nut; it is very variable, and,
together with the position of the seed, the form of the embryo,
the sex of the flowers, etc., gives the characters of the genera.</p>

(<i>C</i>); the embryo is ring-like (<i>H</i>). The leaves have the
ordinary flat forms.&mdash;<i>Chenopodium</i> (Goosefoot). The flower
is hypogynous, and the fruit (which is compressed) perfectly free;
Mulberry-like collections of fruits are formed in some species
(sub-genus <i>Blitum</i>) by the perianth becoming finally fleshy
and coloured.&mdash;<i>Beta</i> (Beet, Mangold, Fig. <a href="#fig365">365</a>) differs from
all genera in the perianth, which finally becomes cartilaginous,
being epigynous (<i>D</i>). Small, most frequently 2–3-flowered
clusters without bracteoles, situated in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span> long, interrupted
axis (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>); the flowers and fruits in each cluster
are more or less united individually, and fall off together&mdash;they
are commonly known as seeds (<i>E</i>, <i>F</i>). The seed lies
horizontally.&mdash;<i>Hablitzia</i> (<i>H. tamnoides</i>).</p>

<i>Salicornia</i> (Glasswort) has a very different appearance. The
stems are succulent, jointed, and almost leafless; the leaves opposite,
very small, sheath-like and connate; there is a depression in the axil
of each leaf, in which a small 3-flowered dichasium without bracteoles
is sunk; the flowers have a trimerous perianth, 1–2 stamens and 1
carpel. No endosperm. <i>S. herbacea</i> on clayey beaches.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> <span class="smcap">Atripliceæ.</span> This group has most frequently

the ♀-flower is naked, but has 2 large, herbaceous bracteoles which
expand during the ripening of the fruit, and often become warted
and fringed, enveloping the <i>compressed nut</i>. <span class="smaller">The section
<i>Dichospermum</i> has two kinds of ♀-flowers, one like those just

<i>Basella</i>, <i>Boussingaultia</i>, <i>Ullucus</i>. The
perianth is sepaloid; ovary 1-ovuled. In <i>Basella</i> the

so rolled together that a tranverse cut divides them in two
places (as in Spirolobeæ). Herbaceous climbing plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> Wind-and self-pollination, as far as

to exclude insect-pollination.&mdash;520 species. Most of them
are annual (out of 26 native species only 5 are perennial);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
inhabiting salt-marshes and salt-steppes, and growing as weeds
(most frequently on garden or field soil containing manure)
in this country, especially species of <i>Chenopodium</i> and
<i>Atriplex</i>. The majority are found outside the Tropics,
and play a very important part, for example, in the Asiatic
salt-steppes. They grow gregariously in large masses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Comparatively few. The only important one is
<i>Beta vulgaris</i> (from the Mediterranean basin), with its
different varieties, viz. Beet-root, Cattle-beet or Red-beet,
Sugar-beet, and others. These are biennial, making in the first
year a root which acts as a reservoir of reserve material, with
a rosette of leaves, and in the second year using this material
in the production of a long stem, leaves and flowers. The
primary root has been developed by cultivation into a very thick
and fleshy tap-root; its mode of increase in thickness deviates
from that of other roots, concentric rings of vascular bundles
being formed from a cambial ring developed outside the previous
ring. In this way several rings of vascular bundles separated
by medullary rays, alternating with rings of parenchyma, may be
found in the root of a Beet. Besides <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, var.
<i>hortensis</i> (Beet-root), the following are also cultivated:
var. <i>cicla</i> (Leaf-beet, “Mangold,” or “Roman Spinach
”), <i>Spinacia oleracea</i> and <i>Atriplex hortensis</i>
as Spinach; a form of the latter and of Spinach are grown as
ornamental plants. The tubers of <i>Ullucus tuberosus</i> are
used as potatoes; <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, in Chili and Peru,
is an important farinaceous plant. Soda is made from some
(<i>Salsola kali</i>, <i>Chenopodina maritima</i> and others).
Aromatic properties are rare: <i>Chenopodium ambrosioides</i>
and <i>botrys</i>.</p>

<p>Order 4. <b>Batidaceæ.</b> <i>Batis maritima</i>, a bushy West
Indian maritime plant.</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Phytolaccaceæ.</b> The ☿ (sometimes unisexual),
regular, sometimes slightly perigynous flowers are inconspicuous
and have a single sepaloid or coloured 4–5-leaved perianth
(generally united at the base); stamens either in 1 whorl in
the spaces between the perianth-leaves or in 1 whorl opposite
the perianth-leaves, or in 2, one of which alternates with
these; but the number may be increased by the splitting
of one or of both the whorls to as many as 10–15–20–25.
<i>Carpels</i> sometimes only one, sometimes <i>many</i>
(4–10) placed in a whorl, either free or united into a
gynœceum with a corresponding number of loculi in the ovary;
but in all cases <i>each carpel bears only its own style and
1 ovule</i>. The fruit is a <i>berry</i> (or nut, capsule,
or schizocarp).&mdash;Mostly herbs or herbaceous shrubs, with
scattered, simple leaves without stipules (<i>Petiverieæ</i>;
have stipules). Inflorescences, most frequently <i>racemes</i>
or spikes, which in some instances are apparently placed
opposite to a leaf, being displaced by a more vigorous growth
of the axillary bud. Embryo always bent.&mdash;<i>Petiveria</i> has
a straight embryo with rolled cotyledons.&mdash;<i>Phytolacca</i>,
<i>Pircunia</i>, <i>Microtea</i>, <i>Seguieria</i>,
<i>Rivina</i> (Pr4, A4, G1; berry), and others.</p>

<p>The following plant is, with some doubt, placed near this order:
<i>Thelygonum cynocrambe</i>; monœcious. ♂-flowers: perianth,
2-leaved; stamens indefinite. ♀-flowers: perianth-leaves united,
3-toothed; G1, style gynobasic. Fruit a drupe. An annual plant;
Mediterranean. Branching anomalous.</p>

<p>About 90 species; in tropical and temperate countries,
principally America and Africa.&mdash;The red juice in the fruits,
especially of <i>Phytol. decandra</i>, is used for colouring
wine.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span></p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Portulacaceæ</b> (<b>Portulacas</b>). The flowers are
regular (except <i>Montia</i>), hypogynous (except <i>Portulaca</i>)
and ☿. The diagram which applies to the majority of genera is that
in Fig. <a href="#fig367">367</a>, but with all the 5 stamens completely developed: it may
be considered as the Chenopodiaceous diagram with the addition of 2
<i>bracteoles</i> in the median line (<i>m-n</i>, these by some are
considered as sepals), and with a petaloid perianth (usually designated
“corolla”). The “petals” fall off very quickly, and are sometimes
wanting. Most frequently 5 stamens, situated opposite the “petals,”
but in other genera the number varies; <i>Montia</i> has only 3
stamens (by suppression of the two anterior and lateral, Fig. <a href="#fig367">367</a>),
others again have more than 5, some a large and indefinite number.
This may be explained partly by the appearance of a second whorl
of stamens alternating with the first, and partly by the splitting
(dédoublement) of the stamens. Gynœceum most frequently tricarpellate,
ovary unilocular with 1–several basal ovules (sometimes on a branched
placenta, as in certain <i>Caryophyllaceæ</i>). The fruit is a
<i>capsule</i>, more rarely a nut.&mdash;The majority are annual herbaceous
plants with scattered, entire leaves, often fleshy and smooth, with or
without rudimentary stipules (dry, membranous, modified into hairs).

but cleft on the posterior side (Fig. <a href="#fig367">367</a>), and as a consequence
of the larger size of the lateral petals, slightly zygomorphic; 3
stamens.&mdash;<i>Calandrinia</i>; <i>Talinum</i>; <i>Anacampseros</i>;
<i>Claytonia</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>125 species; mostly in warm and temperate countries, especially
the arid parts of S. Am. and the Cape. <i>Montia fontana</i>
(Blinks) is a native plant. <i>Portulaca oleracea</i> is
cultivated as a pot-herb in the south of Europe. A few species
of <i>Portulaca</i> and <i>Calandrinia</i> are ornamental plants.</p>

<p>Order 7. <b>Nyctaginiaceæ.</b> The characteristic feature of this
order is the <i>single</i>, regular, <i>united</i>, and often petaloid
perianth, the lower part of which generally persists after flowering
and embraces the fruit as a false pericarp. The upper portion is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
frequently <i>valvate and folded</i>, or simply valvate in æstivation.
The number of stamens varies. The free gynœceum is <i>unicarpellate</i>
and has 1 ovule. The fruit is a <i>nut</i>, but becomes a <i>false
drupe</i>, since the lower persistent portion of the perianth becomes
fleshy (as in <i>Neea</i>, where this fleshy part is almost always
crowned by the upper persistent part of the perianth. In the majority
of the Mirabileæ the lower part becomes the dry <i>anthocarp</i>,
while the upper petaloid part falls away after flowering). Finally,
a peculiar involucre is formed around the flowers by free or united
floral-leaves.&mdash;The majority are herbs, some are trees (<i>Pisonia</i>,
etc.); <i>Bougainvillea</i> is a liane. The stems are often nodose and
swollen at the nodes; the leaves are simple, penninerved, scattered,
or opposite, without stipules. <span class="smaller">In some, the vascular bundles are
scattered; stem anomalous.</span></p>

<p><i>Mirabilis</i>; the structure of the stem is abnormal. Dichasial
branching with continuation from the second bracteole, thus forming
unipared scorpioid cymes. The perianth is petaloid, funnel-shaped,
and has a folded and twisted æstivation resembling that of the
corolla of the <i>Convolvulaceæ</i>; the upper coloured portion
falls off after the flowering. Outside, and alternating with
it, is a 5-partite, sepaloid involucre of 5 spirally-placed
floral-leaves.&mdash;<i>Oxybaphus</i>; the involucre envelops 1–3 dichasial
flowers.&mdash;<i>Bougainvillea</i>; the involucre is rose-coloured,
3-leaved, and envelops 3 flowers (placed laterally; the terminal
flower wanting). The leaves of the involucre in <i>Boerhaavia</i>,
<i>Pisonia</i>, <i>Neea</i>, and others are reduced to teeth or scales.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>157 species; mostly in tropical countries, and especially S. Am.
Species of <i>Mirabilis</i> (Am.) are ornamental plants. Theïn
is found in <i>Neea theïfera</i> Oersted (discovered by Lund in
Lagoa Santa, Brazil), which may be used as a tea-plant.</p>

<p>Order 8. <b>Aizoaceæ.</b> Only 3 <i>whorls</i> are found in
the flower, which <i>alternate</i> with one another when their
leaves are equal in number. The first is sepaloid, the third one
the carpels, and the intervening one is either uncleft, in which
case it is developed as stamens, or it is divided into a large
number of members which then all become stamens (arranged in
groups), or the outermost ones become developed as petals. The
fruit is most frequently a capsule with several loculi. Most of
the species are herbs with thick, fleshy stems, and exstipulate
leaves. The structure of the stem is usually anomalous.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">Aizoideæ</span> have hypogynous or perigynous
flowers with (4–) 5 perianth-leaves; stamens single, or
(by splitting) in groups of 2–3, alternating with the
perianth-leaves. The gynœceum (with 3–5 carpels) has 3–5 loculi
in the ovary, and most frequently numerous ovules in each
loculus, borne on the central placenta formed by the edges
of the carpels. The fruit is a capsule. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span> inflorescences
are dichasia and unipared scorpioid cymes.&mdash;<i>Aizoon</i>,
<i>Mollugo</i>, <i>Sesuvium</i>, and others are herbs or bushes,
most frequently hairy.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">Mesembrianthemeæ</span> have semi- or
wholly-epigynous flowers.&mdash;<i>Tetragonia.</i> The perianth is 4
(more rarely 3–5–6)-merous. Stamens single, or (by splitting)
in groups alternating with the perianth-leaves. There is an
indefinite number of carpels, and each loculus of the ovary
contains <i>only</i> 1 pendulous ovule. Fruit a nut or drupe.
The flowers arise singly in the leaf-axils, with an accessory
foliage-bud below them; in some instances there is also an
accessory flower between this bud and the flower. Southern
hemisphere, especially at the Cape; <i>T. expansa</i>, New
Zealand Spinach, is a fleshy plant which is cultivated as a
pot-herb (Japan, Austr., S. Am.).&mdash;<i>Mesembrianthemum</i>:
the flowers are 5-merous; the numerous linear petals and the
still more numerous stamens all arise by the splitting of 5
or 4 protuberances (primordia) alternating with the sepals.
The ovary presents another characteristic peculiarity: the
carpels alternating with the 5–4 stamens form an ovary (with
several loculi) with the ovules at first borne, as in other
cases, on the <i>inner</i> corner of the inwardly-turned
carpels; but during the subsequent development the whole ovary
is so turned round that the placentæ become parietal and the
ovules assume, apparently, a position very rarely met with in
the vegetable kingdom: on the dorsal suture of the carpels.
Shrubs or under-shrubs, more rarely herbs with fleshy stems and
simple, entire, more frequently thick or triangular leaves,
containing a quantity of water. The flowers open about noon,
and are brightly coloured, generally red or red-violet, but
odourless. The capsules dehisce in rainy weather. 300 species,
mostly found at the Cape. Some are ornamental plants. <i>M.
crystallinum</i> (the Ice-plant) and others are covered with
peculiar, bladder-like, sparkling hairs, the cell-sap of which
contains salt&mdash;these serve as reservoirs of water.</p>

<h4>Family 8. <b>Cactifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The position of this family is very doubtful; but it seems in many
respects to approach <i>Mesembrianthemum</i>. Some botanists place it
near to the Ribesiaceæ; others, again, to the Passifloraceæ. Only 1
order.</p>

  </div>

<p>Order <b>Cactaceæ</b> (<b>The Cacti</b>). The flower is epigynous,
☿, regular, and remarkable for its <i>acyclic</i> structure; there
are, for instance, a large number of spirally-placed sepals and
petals, which gradually pass over into one another, and which in
some species, to a certain extent, arise from the walls of the ovary
as in <i>Nymphæa</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig383">383</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>). The petals are
free; rotate, opening widely in <i>Opuntia</i>, <i>Pereskia</i>, and
<i>Rhipsalis</i>; erect and united at their base into a shorter or
longer tube in <i>Cereus</i>, <i>Epiphyllum</i>, <i>Mammillaria</i>,
<i>Echinocactus</i>, <i>Melocactus</i>, and others (Fig. <a href="#fig369">369</a>).
<i>Stamens numerous</i>, attached to the base of the corolla; gynœceum
formed of <i>many carpels</i>, with one style, dividing into a number
of branches corresponding to the number of carpels; the ovary has
<i>one loculus</i> with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> <i>many parietal</i> placentæ; the ovules
are anatropous, on long and curved funicles. Fruit a berry with
exendospermous seeds. The fruit-pulp is mainly derived from the
funicles.&mdash;The external appearance of the Cactaceæ is very peculiar;
<i>Pereskia</i>, which has thick and fleshy leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig368">368</a>), deviates
the least; foliage-leaves of the usual form are wanting in the other
genera, or are usually very small, and quickly fall off and disappear
(<i>Opuntia</i>), or are modified into thorns; the stem, without normal
foliage-leaves,&mdash;so characteristic a feature in this order,&mdash;makes
its appearance after the two normally developed cotyledons. The stems
are fleshy, perennial, and may finally become woody. In some they are
elongated, globose, pointed, and more or less dichotomously branched,
<i>e.g.</i> in several of the <i>Rhipsalis</i> species, which live
mostly as epiphytes on trees; in others, elongated, branched, globose,
or, most frequently, more or less angular (prismatic) or grooved
and provided with wings, and either columnar and erect (as much as
about 20 metres in height and 1 metre in circumference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span> as in <i>C.
giganteus</i> in New Mexico) or climbing by roots (<i>Cereus</i> and
<i>Rhipsalis</i>-species); in others again, compressed, more or less
leaf-like, often with a ridge in the centre (winged), branched and
jointed: <i>Epiphyllum</i>, <i>Phyllocactus</i>, <i>Opuntia</i>, some
species of <i>Rhipsalis</i>; others are thick, short, spherical or
ovoid, unbranched or only slightly branched, and either studded with
prominent warts (<i>mammillæ</i>) each of which supports a tuft of
thorns (Fig. <a href="#fig368">368</a> <i>A</i>; <i>Mammillaria</i> and others) or with
vertical ridges, separated by furrows (rows of mammillæ which have
coalesced) in <i>Melocactus</i>, <i>Echinocactus</i>, <i>Echinopsis</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig369">369</a>); at the same time the ovary in some is embedded in the stem
so that leaves or leaf-scars, with tufts of thorns in their axils, may
be observed on the ovary just as on the stem.&mdash;The flattened shoots of
the Cactaceæ are formed in various ways, either by the compression of
cylindrical axes (<i>Opuntia</i>) or, as in <i>Melocactus</i>, etc.,
from winged stems in which all the wings are suppressed except two.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The thorns are produced directly from the growing points of
the axillary buds, and are modified leaves. The axillary
bud is united at its base with its subtending leaf, which
as a rule is extremely rudimentary; and these together
form a kind of leaf-cushion, larger in some genera than in
others. This leaf-cushion attains its highest development in
<i>Mammillaria</i>, in which it is a large, conical wart (see
Fig. <a href="#fig368">368</a> <i>A</i>), bearing on its apex the tuft of thorns and
rudimentary lamina.&mdash;The <i>seedlings</i> have normal cotyledons
and a fleshy hypocotyl.</p>

<p>All the species (1,000?) are American (one epiphytic species
of <i>Rhipsalis</i> is indigenous in S. Africa, Mauritius and
Ceylon), especially from the tropical table-lands (Mexico,
etc.). Some species, especially those without thorns, as
<i>Rhipsalis</i>, are epiphytes. <i>Opuntia vulgaris</i>, the
fruits of which are edible, is naturalized in the Mediterranean.
The cochineal insect (<i>Coccus cacti</i>) lives on this and
some closely allied species (<i>O. coccinellifera</i>, etc.),
particularly in Mexico and the Canary Islands. Several are
ornamental plants.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 9. <b>Polycarpicæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers <i>as a rule are</i> ☿, <i>regular</i> and
<i>hypogynous</i>; however in some orders they are unisexual,
<i>e.g.</i> in the Myristicaceæ, or zygomorphic (in Monkshood and
Larkspur in the Ranunculaceæ); in the Lauraceæ, (Fig. <a href="#fig386">386</a>) for example,
perigynous, and in <i>Nymphæa</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig383">383</a>) even partially epigynous
flowers are typical.&mdash;The flowers are acyclic in very many of the
genera of the two first orders, if not completely so, at any rate in
the numerous stamens and carpels, thus denoting an old type. It is a
remarkable characteristic that in the majority of the orders the number
3 prevails in the calyx and corolla; the number 5 also occurs, but
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span> number 2 is seldom met with. Most orders have a double perianth;
chorisis does not occur, suppression is rare, and the parts of the
flower are developed in acropetal succession. The most characteristic
feature in the order is the <i>free, one-leaved</i>, as a rule
<i>numerous carpels</i> (apocarpous gynœceum). The number of carpels
in some of the last mentioned orders dwindles down to 1 (<i>e.g.</i>
the <i>Berberideæ</i> and <i>Myristicaceæ</i>). The carpels in
<i>Nymphæaceæ</i> become united into <i>one pistil</i> (syncarpous), a
condition which we also find distributed among the other orders.</p>

<p><i>Endosperm occurs in almost all</i> the orders (except <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Lauraceæ</i>). The nutritive tissue in <i>Cabombeæ</i> and
<i>Nymphæeæ</i> is chiefly <i>perisperm</i>.</p>

  </div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Ranunculaceæ.</b> Nearly all are <i>herbs</i> (except
<i>Clematis</i>). The leaves are scattered (except <i>Clematideæ</i>),
they have a large sheath with broad base (no stipules), and are
most frequently palminerved with palmate lobes. The flowers are
hypogynous, with most frequently a well pronounced convex receptacle
(Figs. <a href="#fig374">374</a> <i>B</i>, 380), ☿, regular (except <i>Delphinium</i> and
<i>Aconitum</i>); their structure varies very much; in some the leaves
are verticillate, in others arranged spirally; in others, again,
both modes of arrangement are found. It is a characteristic feature
that the various series of leaves (especially calyx and corolla) are
not so distinct or so sharply divided as is usual. The leaves of the
perianth are free, imbricate (except <i>Clematideæ</i>); stamens
<i>numerous</i>, with most frequently extrorse anthers; gynœceum
<i>free</i>, <i>apocarpous</i> (except <i>Nigella</i> and partly
<i>Helleborus</i>), with 1 or several ovules (Figs. <a href="#fig373">373</a>, <a href="#fig378">378</a>, <a href="#fig379">379</a>)
borne on the ventral suture. The fruit is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> either a nut or a follicle
(<i>Actæa</i> has berries). The seed has a <i>large, oil-containing</i>
endosperm and a small embryo (Fig. <a href="#fig374">374</a>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The main axis generally terminates in a flower, and the
lateral axes branch in a cymose manner (Fig. <a href="#fig371">371</a>). The
flowers show the following differences in construction:
<span class="allsmcap">VERTICILLATE</span> (<span class="allsmcap">EUCYCLIC</span>), <i>i.e.</i>
constructed all through of alternating whorls: <i>Aquilegia</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig370">370</a>), <i>Xanthorhiza</i>, and sometimes <i>Eranthis</i>.
<span class="smcap">Semiverticillate</span> (<span class="allsmcap">HEMICYCLIC</span>) <i>i.e.</i> with
sepals and petals in alternate whorls, and the others arranged
spirally: <i>Ranunculus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig371">371</a>), <i>Myosurus</i>,
<i>Pæonia</i> and several other genera entirely, or in certain
species only. <span class="smcap">Spiral-flowered</span> (<span class="allsmcap">ACYCLIC</span>)
<i>i.e.</i> all the leaves are arranged spirally, so that
sepals and petals do not alternate the one with the other,
even though they are the same in number: <i>Adonis</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig372">372</a>), <i>Aconitum</i>, <i>Delphinium</i>-species,
<i>Nigella</i>-species, <i>Helleborus</i>. The leaves of the
calyx are in this instance arranged on a spiral of 2/5; those of
the corolla on 2/5, 3/8, 5/13 or 8/21, and stamens and carpels
likewise on higher fractions of the same series.</p>

<p>The genera <i>Caltha</i>, <i>Anemone</i>, <i>Thalictrum</i>
and <i>Clematis</i> have a <i>single perianth</i>, which
is most frequently petaloid; it is thus apparent that the
sepals are petaloid, and the leaves, which in other genera
have developed as petals, are in these instances stamens. The
calyx is similarly petaloid in the genera <i>Helleborus</i>,
<i>Eranthis</i>, <i>Nigella</i>, <i>Delphinium</i> and
<i>Aconitum</i>; but the petals are present in these instances
in unusual (horn-like) forms, and almost entirely given up to
the function of nectaries, a function they already possess
in <i>Ranunculus</i>. According to a more recent theory the
“honey-leaves” are transformed stamens, which have lost the
function of reproduction; the perianth is then single, and
most frequently petaloid. [Those leaves in the flowers of
many Ranunculaceæ which bear nectaries are termed by Prantl
honey-leaves, and comprise those leaf-structures of the flower
whose essential function lies in the production of nectar,
and which, independent of the differentiation of the perianth
into calyx and corolla, are derived from the stamens by the
loss of their reproductive functions. Clear transitional forms
are found between the two series of the perianth (<i>e.g.</i>
between the sepaloid and petaloid perianth-leaves of <i>Anemone
japonica</i>, <i>A. decapetala</i>, <i>Trollius</i>-species)
while transitional forms are never found between perianth-and
honey-leaves (with the exception of <i>Aquilegia vulgaris</i>,
var. <i>stellata</i>). In <i>Anemone</i> and <i>Clematis</i>
the honey-leaves pass gradually into the stamens, and
agree with the stamens in the other Ranunculaceæ in their
arrangement, development, and scant system of veins (except
<i>Nigella</i>). In <i>Delphinium</i>, sect. <i>Consolida</i>,
the two honey-leaves placed in front of the unpaired
perianth-leaf are united into one, as shown by the veins
(twice three veins arranged symmetrically). The honey-leaves
of <i>Aquilegia</i>, <i>Callianthemum</i>, and the majority of
the <i>Ranunculus</i>-species serve by reason of their large
circumference, as organs of attraction, and on this account
are considered as petals by other authors.&mdash;The same position
in the flower which the honey-leaves assume is found occupied
by staminodes, without nectar, in some <i>Coptis</i>-species,
in <i>Anemonopsis</i>, <i>Actæa</i> sect. <i>Euactæa</i>,
(<i>e.g. A. racemosa</i>), <i>Clematis</i> sect.
<i>Atragene</i>; in the last-named they closely surround the
stamens, in <i>Actæa</i> they are petaloid.&mdash;A perianth,
sharply differentiated into calyx and corolla, and destitute
of honey-leaves, is found in <i>Anemone</i>, sect.
<i>Knowltonia</i> (Cape),</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span></p>

<p><i>Adonis</i>, <i>Pæonia</i>.&mdash;The perianth of the Ranunculaceæ
is considered by Prantl to be usually petaloid.&mdash;The nectaries
arise in the Ranunculaceæ (1) on normal stamens (<i>Clematis</i>
sect. <i>Viorna</i>), (2) on the honey-leaves (this is generally
the case), and (3) on the carpels (<i>Caltha</i> and the
majority of <i>Trollius</i>-species).&mdash;As the result of his
researches upon the Ranunculaceæ, Prantl does not agree with the
view advanced by Drude (Schenk, <i>Hand. d. Bot.</i> iii.) that
the petals in general have proceeded from the metamorphosis of
the stamens (<i>K</i>)].</p>

5–6-leaved perianth, and beneath the flower most frequently <i>an
involucre of 3 leaves</i>, placed close together in the form of
a whorl. In <i>A. nemorosa</i>, <i>ranunculoides</i>, etc., the
involucral leaves resemble foliage-leaves; in <i>A. hepatica</i> they
are situated close under the perianth, and resemble sepals, and in
the sub-genus <i>Pulsatilla</i> they stand between the foliage-leaves
and floral-leaves. The style of <i>Pulsatilla</i> finally grows out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
in the form of a feather. <span class="smaller">The main axis of <i>A. hepatica</i> has
unlimited growth (it is biaxial), and the flowers are borne laterally
in the axils of the scale-leaves; in the others (uniaxial) the flower
is terminal, and the rhizome becomes a sympodium after the first
flowering.</span>&mdash;<i>Thalictrum</i> (Meadow Rue) has no involucre;
4–5-leaved, greenish perianth. The receptacle is flat. <span class="smaller">The stamens
are brightly-coloured and have long filaments; 1–5 accessory flowers
may occur in the leaf-axils of the panicle-like inflorescence.</span></p>

<p><b>6.</b> <span class="smcap">Clematideæ, Clematis Group.</span> This differs from all
the others in the <i>valvate æstivation</i> of the calyx and its
opposite leaves. There are 4 (-several) petaloid sepals; petals are
absent, or linear (<i>Atragene</i>). Ovule 1, pendulous. Achenes, often
with prolonged, feathery style. The majority of the genera are shrubs,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> The flowers are conspicuous either
by coloured petals (honey-leaves) (<i>Ranunculus</i>,
<i>Pæonia</i>) or coloured sepals (<i>Helleborus</i>,
<i>Anemone</i>, <i>Caltha</i>, etc.), or by both
(<i>Aquilegia</i>, <i>Delphinium</i>), or by the
coloured stamens (<i>Thalictrum</i>). Some have no honey
(<i>Clematis</i>, <i>Anemone</i>, <i>Thalictrum</i>),
and are generally visited by insects for the sake of
their pollen. Others have nectaries on the corolla
(<i>Ranunculus</i>, <i>Trollius</i>, <i>Helleborus</i>,
<i>Nigella</i>, <i>Aconitum</i>, etc.), more rarely on the
stamens (<i>Pulsatilla</i>, <i>Clematis</i>-species), or the
carpels (<i>Caltha</i>), or the calyx (certain species of
<i>Pæonia</i>). The honey is readily accessible in the flat,
open flowers, and these flowers also may easily pollinate
themselves. There is marked protandry where the honey lies
deeply hidden, as in <i>Aquilegia</i>, <i>Delphinium</i>,
and <i>Aconitum</i>. <i>Helleborus</i> and some
<i>Ranunculus</i>-species are protogynous.</p>

<p>About 680 species; especially in northern temperate climates,
and extending to the Polar and Alpine regions. Only the
<i>Clematideæ</i> are tropical.</p>

<p>The order has an abundance of <i>acrid</i>, vesicant properties
(<i>R. acer</i>, <i>sceleratus</i>, etc.), and <i>poisonous</i>
alkaloids (<i>Helleborus niger</i> is poisonous).
<span class="smcap">Officinal</span>: <i>Aconitum napellus</i> (aconitine; leaves
and tuberous roots); the rhizome of <i>Hydrastis canadensis</i>
from N. Am. (the alkaloid hydrastine). The order, however, is
best known for its ornamental plants; almost all the genera have
species which are cultivated for their beauty. Sweet-scented
flowers are absent.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Nymphæaceæ (Water Lilies).</b> <span class="smcap">Water Plants</span>;
generally with large, floating leaves, and large solitary flowers;
sepals 3–5, petals 3–∞, stamens 6–∞, carpels 3–∞. The flower is
hypogynous, but in the <i>Nymphæeæ</i> different degrees of epigyny
are found, and from this fact, as well as from the carpels being
united into one pistil, the family forms a lateral offshoot from the
Ranunculaceæ, with much greater modification. The seed often has an
aril, and, in the majority, a farinaceous nutritive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span> tissue, partly
endosperm, partly perisperm (Fig. <a href="#fig383">383</a> <i>C</i>). The embryo has 2 thick

<p>Sepals, petals, and stamens often pass gradually over the one into
the other, the petals becoming narrower by degrees, and bearing
anthers on each side of the apex, which gradually become larger
anthers in proportion to the filament, until the perfect stamen is
developed. The long-stalked leaves are floating, and most frequently
cordate, elliptical, leathery, with a shiny surface, sometimes (as
in <i>Victoria regia</i> and <i>Euryale ferox</i>) with strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
projecting thorny ribs on the lower surface. In the intercellular
passages of the leaves are some peculiar, stellate cells.</p>

<p><i>Nuphar</i> has 5 sepals, and an <i>hypogynous</i> flower. <span class="smaller">The
petals, which are small, have a nectary on the back; the coloured inner
side of the sepals functions as petals; the ovate gynœceum is quite
free.&mdash;<i>N. luteum</i> is a native plant (Yellow Water-Lily), with,
most frequently, 13 petals and 10–16 loculi in the ovary. The rhizome
is horizontal, as much as 5–6 cm. in thickness, and bears on its under
surface a number of roots, which on dying-off leave deep scars; the
leaves are borne in spiral lines, and the flowers are solitary in
certain leaf-axils. The construction of the rhizome is very peculiar;
the vascular bundles are scattered and closed as in a monocotyledonous
stem.</span></p>

<i>Nuphar</i> and <i>Victoria</i> can effect self-fertilisation;
<i>Euryale</i> is self-fertilised, often in entirely closed and
submerged flowers.&mdash;The dissemination of the seeds in <i>Nuphar
luteum</i> is effected by the fruit, which rests on the water,
becoming detached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span> from its stalk, and dehiscing from the base
upwards so that the seeds are set free; while in <i>Nymphæa
alba</i> the spirally-twisted stalk draws the fruit under water,
and it dehisces by its upper part being thrown off as a hood,
and the seeds which are enclosed in air-tight sacs rise to the

<p>Order 3. <b>Ceratophyllaceæ.</b> About 3 species. Aquatic plants,
submerged, rootless; leaves cartilaginous, verticillate, dissected
into repeatedly dichotomous branches which are finely toothed; only
one of the leaves in a whorl supports a vegetative branch. The flowers
are <i>monœcious</i>, axillary. Inside the 6–12 perianth-leaves are
situated in the ♂-flower 10–20 stamens with thick connective, and in
the ♀-flower a gynœceum formed by one carpel, with one orthotropous and
pendulous ovule, which has only one integument. Fruit a nut, which,
in some species, bears on each side a pointed horn, and at the apex

an <i>apocarpous gynœceum</i>; the flowers are hypogynous,
regular and ☿, generally very large (2–3 cm. in diameter), and
the leaves of the perianth are more or less fleshy or leathery.
The majority have syncarps with berry-like fruitlets, but in
<i>Annona</i> and some others the carpels fuse together into a
large, head-like fruit&mdash;a kind of composite berry. The seeds
have <i>ruminate</i> endosperm as in <i>Myristica</i>.&mdash;Trees or
shrubs with <i>alternate</i>, simple, entire, penninerved leaves
without stipules. 450 (700?) species; especially tropical. The
best known are <i>Anona cherimolia</i>, <i>squamosa</i> and
<i>reticulata</i> (all from America) cultivated on account of
their large, delicious fruits. Some have acrid and aromatic
properties (<i>Xylopia</i>, <i>Cananga</i>&mdash;the flowers of the
latter yield Ylang-ylang); <i>Artabotrys odoratissimus</i>;
<i>Asimina</i> (N. Am.).</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Magnoliaceæ.</b> Trees or shrubs with scattered,
often leathery, entire leaves, generally with <i>stipules</i>,
which (as in <i>Ficus</i>) are rolled together and form a hood
round the younger internodes above them, and are cast off by
the unfolding of the next leaf, leaving a ring-like scar. The
endosperm is <i>not ruminate</i>. Corolla imbricate. Fruit a
syncarp.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Magnolieæ.</span> The flowers are borne singly, and
before opening are enveloped in an ochrea-like spathe which
corresponds to the stipules of the foliage-leaves. The perianth
generally consists of 3 trimerous whorls, the external one
of which is sometimes sepaloid (<i>Liriodendron</i>, and the
majority of <i>Magnolia</i>species),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span> sometimes coloured like
the others; the perianth is sometimes many-seriate. <i>Numerous
spirally-placed</i> stamens and carpels. The latter are situated
on the <i>elongated</i>, cylindrical receptacle, and are
individually more or less united, except in <i>Liriodendron</i>,
where they are free. This last genus has winged achenes; the
fruitlets in <i>Magnolia</i> open along the dorsal and ventral
sutures, and the seeds then hang out, suspended by elastic
threads formed from the vascular bundles of the funicle and
raphe; they are red and drupaceous, the external layer of the
shell being fleshy&mdash;a very rare occurrence.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Illicieæ</span> has no stipules. The carpels

<p>70 species; in tropical or temperate climates; none in Europe
or Africa. They are chiefly used as ornamental plants,
<i>e.g.</i> the Tulip-tree (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>, N.
Am.), <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i> (N. Am.), <i>M. yulan</i>
and <i>fuscata</i> (China), and others. The remains of

bark of <i>Drimys winteri</i> (S. Am.) is also strongly aromatic.</p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Calycanthaceæ.</b> These are very closely related
to the Magnoliaceæ, but differ in having <i>perigynous</i>
flowers with many perianth-leaves, stamens and (about 20)
carpels in a continuous <i>spiral</i>, seeds <i>almost devoid of
endosperm</i> with rolled up, leaf-like cotyledons, and leaves
opposite on a square stem.&mdash;There are some species in N. America
(<i>Calycanthus florida</i>, <i>occidentalis</i>, etc.) and 1 in
Japan (<i>Chimonanthus præcox</i>), all strongly aromatic.</p>

<p>Order 7. <b>Monimiaceæ.</b> Aromatic shrubs with opposite
leaves. Perigynous flowers. The anthers dehisce by valves like
those of the <i>Lauraceæ</i>, and the Monimiaceæ may thus
be considered as an apocarpous form of this order. They are
also closely related to <i>Calycanthaceæ</i>. 150 species,
tropical.&mdash;<i>Hedycarya, Mollinedia, Monimia.</i></p>

<p><i>Berberis</i> is a shrub; it has sepals 3 + 3, petals 3 + 3, stamens
3 + 3 (Fig. <a href="#fig384">384</a>). The petals (honey-leaves) bear internally at the base
2 darkish-yellow nectaries. The filaments are sensitive at the base,
and suddenly bend inwards if touched at that spot (Fig. <a href="#fig385">385</a>). <span class="smaller">The
racemes often have a terminal, 5-merous flower; they are borne on
dwarf-branches. The leaves on the long-branches develope into thorns,
but the buds in their axils, in the same year as themselves, develope
as the short-branches with simple foliage-leaves, <i>articulated</i>
at the base, from which fact some authorities have considered that the
leaf is compound with a single, terminal leaflet.</span>&mdash;<i>Mahonia</i>

<p>Order 11. <b>Lauraceæ</b> (<b>True Laurels</b>). Trees or shrubs; the
leaves, always without stipules, are simple, most frequently scattered,
lanceolate or elliptical, entire, penninerved, finely reticulate
(except <i>Cinnamomum</i> with 3–5-veined leaf), leathery and evergreen
(except, <i>e.g. Cinnamomum</i>); they are frequently studded
with clear glands containing <i>volatile oil</i>. The flowers are
borne in panicles and are small and of a greenish or whitish colour.
They are <i>regular, perigynous</i>, with most frequently a bowl or
cup-shaped receptacle (Fig. <a href="#fig386">386</a>), usually ☿, and <i>trimerous</i>
(rarely dimerous) through all (most frequently 6–7) whorls; viz. most
frequently, perianth 2 whorls, stamens 3–4 and carpels 1 (P3 + 3, A3 +
3 + 3 + 3, G3) in regular alternation (Fig. <a href="#fig387">387</a>). Each of the 2 or 4
loculi of the anthers <i>open by an upwardly directed valve</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig386">386</a>); of the stamens, the 2 outermost whorls are generally introrse,
the others extrorse, or 1–3 whorls are developed as staminodes (Fig.

ovule (Fig. <a href="#fig386">386</a>), and may be considered as formed of 3 carpels. The
fruit is a <i>berry</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig388">388</a>) or <i>drupe</i>, which often is
surrounded at its base by the persistent receptacle (as an acorn by
its cupule), which becomes fleshy and sometimes coloured during the
ripening of the fruit. The embryo has 2 thick cotyledons, but <i>no

<p>There are 1000 species; especially in the forests of tropical S.
America and Asia, of which they form the principal part. Only
<i>Laurus nobilis</i> is found in Europe, and there is little
doubt that its proper home is in Western Asia. They are rare
in Africa.&mdash;On account of <i>the volatile oil</i> found in all
parts of the plant, they are used as <i>spices</i>, <i>e.g.</i>
the false Cinnamon-tree (<i>Dicypellium caryophyllatum</i>, in
the Brazils). The <span class="allsmcap">OFFICINAL</span> ones are&mdash;the Cinnamon-tree
(<i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i> from Ceylon, E. India, Eastern
Asia), which is also cultivated; the Camphor-tree (<i>Cinnamomum
camphora</i>, Eastern Asia). The Laurel-tree (<i>Laurus
nobilis</i>, Mediterranean), the berries and leaves of which
give laurel oil, is medicinal.&mdash;Scented wood for furniture,
etc., is obtained from <i>Sassafras officinalis</i> (from N.
Am.). The wood from its roots is officinal. Pichurim “beans” are
the large cotyledons of <i>Nectandra pichury</i>, whilst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
famous “Greenheart” wood of Demarara is the wood of <i>Nectandra
rodiæi</i>. The pulp and seeds contain a <i>fatty oil</i>.
The pear-like fruit of <i>Persea gratissima</i> (Mexico, also
cultivated) is very delicious. <i>Lindera benzoin</i> is a
garden shrub; <i>Laurus nobilis</i> likewise.</p>

<p>Order 12. <b>Myristicaceæ</b> (<b>Nutmegs</b>). In this order
there is only 1 genus, <i>Myristica</i>. Trees or shrubs.
The leaves agree closely with those of the Lauraceæ, with
which this order has many points in common. The majority of
the species are aromatic, having in their vegetative parts
pellucid glands with volatile oils. The flowers are regular,
diœcious, trimerous, and have a single gamophyllous (cupular or
campanulate) 3-toothed, fleshy perianth. In the ♂-flowers the
anthers vary in number (3–15), and they are extrorse and borne
on a centrally-placed column; in the ♀-flower the gynœceum is
unilocular, unicarpellary, with 1 ovule. The <span class="allsmcap">FRUIT</span>
(Fig. <a href="#fig389">389</a>) has the form of a pear; it is a fleshy, yellow
capsule, which opens along the ventral and dorsal sutures,
exposing the large seed. This seed has a large, red, irregularly
branched aril&mdash;the so-called “mace”; the “nutmeg,” on the other
hand, is the seed itself with the inner thin portion of the
testa, which has pushed its way irregularly into the endosperm,
and causes the marbled appearance of the cut seed (Fig. <a href="#fig390">390</a>);
the external, dark brown, hard, and brittle part of the
seed-shell is however removed. Mace and nutmeg contain volatile
and fatty oils in abundance.&mdash;80 species. Tropical. The majority
are used on account of their aromatic seeds and aril, the most
important being <i>M. fragrans</i> (<i>moschata</i>), from the
Moluccas. This is cultivated in special plantations, not only in
its native home, but in other tropical countries also. Nutmegs
were known as commodities in Europe in very ancient times
(<i>e.g.</i> by the Romans), but it was not until the year 1500
that the tree itself was known. The seed is <span class="allsmcap">OFFICINAL</span>.</p>

<h4>Family 10. <b>Rhœadinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The plants belonging to this family are almost exclusively herbaceous,
with scattered, exstipulate leaves. The flowers are eucyclic di- or
tetramerous, with the calyx and corolla deciduous, <i>hypogynous</i>,
☿, <i>regular</i>, the gynœceum with 2–several carpels (generally
2, transversely placed) (Figs. <a href="#fig391">391</a>, <a href="#fig392">392</a>, <a href="#fig393">393</a>, <a href="#fig397">397</a>). The ovary is
<i>unilocular with parietal placentæ</i>, but in <i>Cruciferæ</i> and a
few others it becomes bilocular by the development of a <i>false</i>,
membranous wall between the placentæ. The stigmas in the majority
of cases are <i>commissural</i>, <i>i.e.</i> they stand above the
placentæ, and not above the dorsal line of the carpels. The fruit is
nearly always a <i>capsule</i>, which opens by the middle portions
of the carpels detaching themselves as valves, bearing no seed,
whilst the placentæ persist as the seed-bearing frame. Endosperm is
found in <i>Papaveraceæ</i> and <i>Fumariaceæ</i>, but is absent in
<i>Cruciferæ</i> and <i>Capparidaceæ</i>.&mdash;<span class="smaller">This family through the
Papaveraceæ is related to the Polycarpicæ (the Nymphæaceæ), through the
Capparidaceæ to the Resedaceæ in the next family.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Exceptions to the above are: <i>Eschscholtzia</i>,
<i>Subularia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig403">403</a>) and a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span> Capparidaceæ, in
which perigynous flowers are found. A few Papaveraceæ and
Fumariaceæ have trimerous flowers. In <i>Fumaria</i> and certain
Cruciferæ, the fruit is a nut. The Fumariaceæ have zygomorphic
flowers. Trees and shrubs are almost entirely confined to the
Capparidaceæ, in which order stipules also are found.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Papaveraceæ</b> (<b>Poppies</b>). Herbaceous plants with
stiff hairs and <i>latex</i>; flowers <i>regular</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig391">391</a>)
with generally 2 (-3) sepals (which <i>fall off</i> as the flower
opens), 2 + 2 petals (imbricate and crumpled in the bud) <i>without
spur, numerous stamens in several alternating whorls</i> (generally
a multiple of 2); carpels 2–several, united into a unilocular
gynœceum. Trimerous flowers also occur. Capsule with very numerous
seeds on the parietal placentæ; embryo small, with large, oleaginous

<p><i>Papaver</i> (Poppy) has large, solitary, terminal flowers; petals

(4–15) carpels; stigmas velvety, <i>sessile</i> and <i>stellate</i>
(the rays stand above the placentæ) (Fig. <a href="#fig392">391</a> <i>B</i>). The edges
of the carpels project deeply into the ovary, but do not meet in the
centre, so that it remains unilocular. The capsule opens by pores
placed close beneath the stigma, and formed of small valves alternating
with the placentæ and the rays of the stigma (Fig. <a href="#fig391">391</a>). <i>P.
dubium</i>, <i>P. argemone</i>, <i>P. rhœas</i>.&mdash;<i>Chelidonium</i>
(Greater Celandine) has <i>yellow</i> latex, flowers in umbellate
cymes (the terminal, central flower opening first) and only 2
carpels; the fruit resembles the siliqua<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span> of the Cruciferæ in having
two <i>barren valves</i>, which are detached from the base upwards,
and a <i>seed-bearing frame</i>, but there is no partition wall
formed between the placentæ. <i>Ch. majus.</i>&mdash;<span class="smaller">The majority
of the other genera have, like <i>Chelidonium</i>, 2 carpels
(lateral and alternating with the sepals: Fig. <a href="#fig391">391</a> <i>A</i>) and
siliqua-like fruit, thus: <i>Eschscholtzia</i> (perigynous) with
a linear, stigma-bearing prolongation extending as far above the
placentæ as above the dorsal suture of the carpels; <i>Glaucium</i>
(Horn-Poppy); <i>G. luteum</i>, whose extremely long, thin capsule
differs from that of <i>Chelidonium</i> by the formation, during
ripening, of a thick, spongy (<i>false</i>) replum, which persists
when the valves are detached; <i>Sanguinaria</i> with red latex, the
2 petals divided into 8–12 small petals (perhaps by dédoublement);
<i>Macleya</i> and <i>Bocconia</i> (1-seeded capsule) with 2 sepals
and no petals.&mdash;Trimerous flowers are found in <i>Argemone</i>
and <i>Platystemon</i> (with a curious fruit, carpels free, and
transversely divided and constricted into joints which separate as
nut-like portions).&mdash;<i>Meconopsis.</i>&mdash;<i>Hypecoum</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig393">393</a>
<i>C</i>) has tri-lobed and three cleft petals, 4 free stamens with
4-locular anthers and a jointed siliqua; it presents a transitional
form to the Fumariaceæ, with which order it is sometimes included.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> <i>Papaver</i> and <i>Chelidonium</i> have
no honey, and are without doubt only visited by insects for the
sake of the pollen. The anthers and stigmas mature about the
same time.&mdash;There are 80 species; especially from warm climates.
<span class="smcap">Officinal</span>: <i>Papaver somniferum</i> (Opium-Poppy);
the latex of its unripe capsules is obtained by incisions, and
dried (<i>opium</i>); it contains many alkaloids: morphine,
papaverine, narcotine, thebaine, etc. The oleaginous seeds are
also used in the manufacture of oil. Its home is in the East,
where it is extensively cultivated. The petals of the Corn-poppy
(<i>P. rhœas</i>) are also officinal. Several species are
cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Fumariacæ</b> (<b>Fumitories</b>). This order differs
from the closely allied Papaveraceæ in the absence of latex, a poorer
flower, generally <i>transversely zygomorphic</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig393">393</a> <i>B</i>),
in which case one or both of the outer lateral petals are gibbous, or
prolonged into a spur; the stamens are especially anomalous. Sepals
<b>2</b>, caducous; petals 2 + 2; stamens 2, <i>tripartite</i>; each
lateral anther is <i>bilocular</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig393">393</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>;
395); gynœceum bicarpellate. The fruit is a nut or siliqua-like
capsule. <i>Endosperm.</i>&mdash;<i>Herbs</i> with scattered, repeatedly
pinnately-divided leaves without stipules, generally quite glabrous and
glaucous; the flowers are arranged in racemes with subtending bracts,
but the bracteoles are sometimes suppressed.</p>

<p><i>Dicentra</i> (syn. <i>Dielytra</i>) and <i>Adlumia</i> have a
doubly symmetrical flower, with a spur or gibbous swelling at the base
of <i>each</i> of the laterally-placed petals (Figs. <a href="#fig393">393</a> <i>A</i>,
<a href="#fig394">394</a>). <i>Corydalis</i> has a zygomorphic flower, <i>only one of</i>
the lateral petals <i>having a spur</i>, and consequently there is
only one nectary at the base of the bundle of stamens, which stands
right in front of the spur (Fig.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span> <a href="#fig393">393</a> <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig395">395</a>, <a href="#fig396">396</a>). The fruit
is a many-seeded siliqua-like capsule. <span class="smaller">A peculiarity of the flower
is that the plane of symmetry passes <i>transversely</i> through the
flowers, whilst in nearly all other zygomorphic flowers it lies in
the median line. Moreover, the flower is turned, so that the plane of
symmetry ultimately becomes nearly vertical, and the spur is directed
backwards.&mdash;Many species have subterranean tubers; in these the
embryo germinates with <i>one cotyledon</i>, which is lanceolate and
resembles a foliage-leaf. The tuber is in some the swollen hypocotyl
(<i>C. cava</i>), in others a swollen root (<i>C. fabacea</i>, etc.),
which grows down through the precisely similar swollen root of the
mother-plant. The sub-genus <i>Ceratocapnos</i> has dimorphic fruits
(nuts and capsules) in the same raceme.</span> <i>Fumaria</i> differs from

<p><span class="smcap">The structure of the flower.</span> <i>Hypecoum</i> among the
Papaveraceæ is the connecting link with the Fumariaceæ. The
diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig393">393</a> <i>C</i>) corresponds both in number and in
the relative position of its members with that of most of the
other Papaveraceæ (Fig. <a href="#fig391">391</a>), except that there are only four
stamens (with extrorse anthers). In <i>Dicentra</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig393">393</a>
<i>A</i>), the two central (uppermost) stamens are absent, but
each of the two lateral ones are divided into three filaments,
of which the central one bears a four-locular anther, and each
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span> others a two-locular (half) anther. <i>Corydalis</i>
and <i>Fumaria</i> stand alone in the symmetry of the flower,
differing from <i>Dicentra</i> in having only one of the
lateral petals (Fig. <a href="#fig393">393</a> <i>B</i>, <i>sp</i>) prolonged into
a spur, while in <i>Dicentra</i> both the petals are spurred.
This structure has been interpreted in various ways. According
to Asa Gray the median stamens are absent in the last-named
genera, and the lateral ones are split in a similar manner to
the petals of <i>Hypecoum</i>. Another, and no doubt the most
reasonable theory (adduced by De Candolle), is: that two median
stamens are split, the two parts move laterally, each to their
respective sides and become united with the two lateral stamens;
this affords a natural explanation of the two half-anthers,
and establishes a close relationship to the Cruciferæ. A third
interpretation, held by Eichler and others, is as follows: the
median stamens are <i>always</i> wanting; when they appear to be
present, as in <i>Hypecoum</i>, it is due to the fact that the
side portions of the lateral stamens <i>approach each other</i>
(as interpetiolar stipules) and coalesce into an apparently
single stamen.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Cruciferæ (Crucifers).</b> The flowers are <i>regular</i>,
☿; sepals 4, free (2 + 2), deciduous; petals 4, free, deciduous,
unguiculate, placed <i>diagonally</i> in one whorl, and alternating
with the sepals; stamens 6; the 2 <i>outer</i> are <i>short</i>,
the 4 <i>inner</i> (in reality the two median split to the base)
<i>longer</i>, placed in pairs (tetradynamia of Linnæus); gynœceum
syncarpous formed by 2 (as in the previous order, lateral) carpels,
with 2 parietal placentæ, but divided into two loculi by a
<i>spurious</i> membranous dissepiment (<i>replum</i>) (Fig. <a href="#fig397">397</a>).
Style single, with a capitate, usually two-lobed stigma, generally
commisural, that is, placed above the parietal placentæ (Fig.
<a href="#fig397">397</a>), but it may also be placed above the dorsal suture, or remain
undivided. Ovules <i>curved</i>. The fruit is generally a bivalvular
<i>siliqua</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig398">398</a> <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>), the valves separating
from below upwards, and leaving the placentæ attached to the replum;
other forms of fruits are described below. The oily seeds <i>have no
endosperm</i> (endosperm is present in the two previous orders); the
<i>embryo is curved</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig398">398</a> <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>; <a href="#fig399">399</a>, <a href="#fig400">400</a>).&mdash;In
general they are <i>herbaceous</i> plants, without latex, with
scattered, penninerved leaves, without stipules; the inflorescence
is very characteristic, namely, a raceme with the flowers aggregated
together at the time of flowering into a corymb, and <i>destitute of
both bracts and bracteoles</i>.</p>

<p>Many are biennial, forming in the first year a close
leaf-rosette. By cultivation the tap-root can readily be induced
to swell out into the form of a tuber (Turnips, Swedes, etc.).
<i>Stipules</i> are found indicated by small glands on the very
young leaves; in <i>Cochlearia armoracia</i> they are fairly
large triangular scales. <i>Stellate hairs</i> often occur.
<i>Floral-leaves</i> are occasionally developed. Terminal
flowers are never found in the inflorescences. <i>Iberis</i>
and <i>Teesdalia</i> have <i>zygomorphic</i> flowers.
<i>Subularia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig403">403</a>) is perigynous. The 2 external
sepals (Fig. <a href="#fig397">397</a>) stand in the median plane; it may therefore
be supposed that there are two bracteoles outside these which,
however, are suppressed, and can only in a few instances be
traced in the young flower; the two lateral sepals are often
gibbous at the base, and serve as reservoirs for the nectar
secreted by the glands placed above them; they correspond in
position to the external petals of the Fumariaceæ. The 4 petals
which follow next arise simultaneously, and alternate with the
4 sepals; if it could be shown that these are merely 2 median
petals, which have been deeply cleft and the two parts separated
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> each other and displaced to the diagonal position, there
would be a perfect correspondence with the Fumariaceous flower;
then the petals would be followed in regular alternation by
the 2 lateral small stamens, the 2 median long stamens, which
it has been proved are split into 4 and placed in couples, and
the 2 laterally-placed carpels,&mdash;in all 6 dimerous whorls.
But the formation of the corolla by the splitting of 2 petals
does not agree with the development of the flower or bear
comparison, and hence the only fact in favour of this theory is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
the otherwise prevailing correspondence with the Fumariaceæ.
Yet it may be observed that in special cases each pair of long
stamens clearly enough arises from one protuberance and even
later on may be considerably united or entirely undivided
(<i>e.g. Vella</i>); in other instances they are quite
distinct from the beginning, and it is possible that this latter
condition has become constant in the corolla. <i>Lepidium
ruderale</i> and others have no corolla. <i>Senebiera didyma</i>
has only 2 median stamens. <i>Megacarpæa</i> has several
stamens, no doubt by dédoublement, as in Capparidaceæ.&mdash;The
<i>number of carpels</i> may also be abnormally increased;
<i>Tetrapoma barbareifolium</i> has normally 4 carpels with
an equal number of placentæ and repla. It is supposed to be a
variety of <i>Nasturtium palustre</i>.&mdash;The 2–4–8–10 greenish
<i>glands</i>, which are found at the base of the stamens, are
nectaries, morphologically emergences, and not rudimentary
stamens. The forms of <i>fruits</i> are of great systematic
significance, see the genera. In some species dimorphic fruits
are present, <i>e.g. Cardamine chenopodiifolia</i>
which has both ordinary <i>Cardamine</i>-siliquas and 1-seeded
siliculas.</p>

<p>The <i>curved embryo</i> appears in five forms, which have
systematic importance: 1. To the <span class="smcap">Pleurorhizæ</span>
belong those genera whose radicle (with the hypocotyl)
lies bent upwards along the <i>edge</i> of the <i>flat</i>
cotyledons (Fig. <a href="#fig399">399</a>); to this group belong <i>Cardamine</i>,
<i>Nasturtium</i>, <i>Cheiranthus</i>, <i>Matthiola</i>,
<i>Cochlearia</i>, <i>Draba</i>, <i>Iberis</i>, <i>Thlaspi</i>,
etc.; diagrammatic transverse section: ◯=.&mdash;2. To
<span class="smcap">Notorhizæ</span> belong those whose radicle lies in an upward
direction along the <i>back</i> of one of the <i>flat</i>
cotyledons (Figs. <a href="#fig400">400</a>, <a href="#fig412_413">413</a>); <i>e.g. Hesperis</i>,
<i>Sisymbrium</i>, <i>Lepidium</i>, <i>Capsella</i>,
<i>Camelina</i>: ◯‖.&mdash;3. <span class="smcap">Orthoploceæ</span> differ from the
Notorhizeæ in having the cotyledons folded (not flat) (Fig.
<a href="#fig398">398</a> <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>); to this belong <i>Brassica</i>,
<i>Sinapis</i>, <i>Raphanus</i>, <i>Crambe</i>, etc.: ◯&gt;&gt;.&mdash;4.
<span class="smcap">Spirolobeæ</span>: the radicle lies as in the Notorhizæ,
but the cotyledons are so rolled together that a transverse
section of the seed cuts them twice; <i>Bunias</i>: ◯‖‖.&mdash;5.

<p>Order 4. <b>Capparidaceæ</b> (<b>Capers</b>). The relationship
with the Cruciferæ is so close that certain forms are with
difficulty distinguished from them. The diagram of the flower
is the same in the number and position of its parts, but it
differs in the modifications which occur in the development of
the stamens. In some genera all 4 stamens are undivided; in
others both the 2 median ones are divided as in the Cruciferæ
(6 stamens, but <i>not tetradynamous</i>) (Fig. <a href="#fig414">414</a>); in other
genera only 1 of these; in other instances again they are
divided into more than 2; and finally the 2 lateral ones also
may be found divided, so that <i>indefinite stamens</i> occur
(Fig. <a href="#fig415">415</a>). The bicarpellate gynœceum is <i>unilocular</i>
(without replum), but more than 2 carpels may occur. The ovary
is elevated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span> on a <i>stalk</i> (sometimes as much as 1 foot
in length); also between the stamens and corolla a similar
stalk may be found (Fig. <a href="#fig414">414</a>). The fruit is long and siliquose
(<i>Cleome</i>, <i>Polanisia</i>, <i>Gynandropsis</i>), or a
berry (<i>Capparis</i>). Endosperm absent. Some have zygomorphic
flowers. Gamosepalous calyx and perigynous flowers also
occur.&mdash;350 species; especially in the Tropics. The majority are
trees and shrubs, and they differ also from the Cruciferæ in
having distinct stipules present in some species.</p>

<p>“Capers” are the flower buds of the climbing, thorny shrub,
<i>Capparis spinosa</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig415">415</a>), which grows in the
Mediterranean.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 11. <b>Cistifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers in this family are perfect, regular (except <i>Resedaceæ,
Violaceæ</i>), hypogynous, the perianth-leaves free (a few have them
slightly united), æstivation most frequently imbricate; they are
eucyclic in the andrœcium, and most frequently in the other parts, and
generally 5-merous with S5, P5, A5 + 5, G3, but other numbers also
occur; several have <i>indefinite stamens</i>, but the stamens arise
(where the development is known) in <i>centrifugal order</i> and are
arranged, often very distinctly, <i>in bundles</i>; in other words,
the large number of stamens is formed by the splitting of a small
number (most frequently 5); a true spiral arrangement is never found.
Gynœceum syncarpous, multicarpellary (<i>Dilleniaceæ</i> and a few
<i>Resedaceæ</i> are apocarpous), most frequently the number of carpels
is 3, forming a <i>unilocular ovary</i> with <i>parietal placentæ</i>,
but parallel with this, multilocular ovaries, with the ovules placed
in the inner angle of the loculi, are also found, and a few genera
have a free, centrally-placed placenta. The fruit is most frequently
a capsule. The dehiscence is never with a “replum,” <i>i.e.</i> the
persistent frame of the placenta, as in the family Rhœadinæ. One
half of the orders has endosperm (<i>Violaceæ</i>, <i>Cistaceæ</i>,
<i>Droseraceæ</i>, <i>Bixaceæ</i>, <i>Ternstrœmiaceæ</i>, etc.),
the other has no endosperm (<i>Resedaceæ</i>, <i>Hypericaceæ</i>,
<i>Elatinaceæ</i>, <i>Tamaricaceæ</i>, etc.); some have a curved, the
majority a straight embryo. <span class="smaller">The family is scarcely quite natural; in
the future the orders will probably be arranged differently.</span></p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Resedaceæ (Mignonettes).</b>&mdash;Herbs or small shrubs with
spirally-placed leaves and very small, gland-like stipules (as in
Cruciferæ); the ☿, hypogynous flowers are <i>zygomorphic</i>, and
arranged in racemes or spikes typically without bracteoles. The
zygomorphic structure is produced by the <i>greater development of the
posterior side of the flower</i>, especially the petals and the nectary
(“disc,” in Fig. <a href="#fig416">416</a> <i>d</i>) which is situated between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span> the petals
and stamens; in general there are 5–8 free sepals and petals, the
latter consisting of a large scale-like <i>sheath</i> with a fimbriated
blade (see Fig. <a href="#fig416">416</a>); stamens numerous; carpels 6–2 united together;
ovary unilocular with parietal placentæ, but <i>the cavity of the
ovary is not closed</i> at the top. In <i>Astrocarpus</i> the gynœceum
is apocarpous. The fruit is most frequently a capsule; the seeds are
reniform, without endosperm, and the embryo is <i>curved</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This order connects the Rhœadinæ with the Cistifloræ. It is
closely allied to the Rhœadinæ by its external appearance, even
by the smell and taste, the parietal placentation, structure of
the seeds, the inflorescences, etc., whilst by the irregular
flowers and the disc placed at the posterior side of the
flower, <i>it is allied to Capparidaceæ</i>, but differs from
this order in not having its characteristic number (2–4) and
by the very different mode of dehiscence of the fruit, etc. It
differs from the other orders of this family chiefly in the
fact that the number of the perianth-leaves is not constantly
5. In <i>Reseda luteola</i> both the calyx and corolla appear
to be 4-leaved, because the posterior sepal is suppressed, and
the 2 posterior petals are united. Where there are 10 stamens,
they stand in 2 whorls, <i>i.e.</i> in front of the sepals and
petals; if there are several, their position depends upon the
splitting.&mdash;<i>Astrocarpus</i> is remarkable for its apocarpous
fruit and the position of the ovules on the <i>dorsal</i> suture
of the carpel.</p>

<p>The yellow, flat disc at the back of the flower serves as a
nectary, the honey being protected by the lobes of the petals.
If pollination by insects is not effected, then self-pollination
may take place, at all events in <i>R. odorata</i>.</p>

<p>45 species; the majority in the Mediterranean and in Persia.
<i>Reseda odorata</i> (from Egypt) is cultivated on account of
its sweet scent; <i>R. luteola</i> (“Dyer’s Weed”) yields a
yellow dye.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Droseraceæ (Sundews).</b> Herbs, chiefly living on moors
or in water, and whose leaves are adapted to catch and digest small
animals. With regard to the flower, they are closely allied to the
Violaceæ, especially to those with regular flowers. <i>Drosera</i>
(Sundew) has a long-stalked scorpioid cyme with regular, ☿, hypogynous
flowers, 5-merous as in <i>Viola</i>. S5, P5, A5, G3 (in a syncarpous
gynœceum, with free, bifid styles and basal or parietally-placed ovules
in the unilocular ovaries). The capsule opens also as in <i>Viola</i>,
but, among other differences, the styles are free, the seeds very
small, and surrounded by a loosely lying, thin shell. <span class="smaller"><i>Drosera</i>
has radical, long-stalked leaves with the blade (Fig. <a href="#fig417">417</a>) covered by
numerous strong glandular hairs, placed on the edge and in the middle;
when small animals are caught by these hairs, the latter and the
entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span> blade close slowly over them dissolving and absorbing all the
digestible matter as nourishment.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dionæa muscipula</i> (Fly-trap; N. Am.) has the same
appearance as <i>Drosera</i>, but the leaves are constructed
as in Fig. <a href="#fig418">418</a>. The stalk is flat and winged, the blade small,
circular, with powerful, pointed teeth along the edge, and on
its surface are 6 small bristles (<i>A</i>), which are very
sensitive. When these are touched the blade quickly closes,
folding along the midrib (<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>) and imprisoning
the irritating object, the teeth round the edges fitting like
the teeth of a trap. If it happens to be an insect or similar
body, a digestive fluid is secreted which, like the gastric
juice, dissolves the digestible portions. <i>Aldrovandia
vesiculosa</i> (Central and S. Europe) captures small aquatic
animals in a similar manner; it is a floating, aquatic plant,
the two halves of its leaves also close together when irritated
(Fig. <a href="#fig419A">419</a>).&mdash;<i>Drosophyllum.</i></p>

<p>Orders 3 and 4. <b>Sarraceniaceæ and Nepenthaceæ.</b> These
two orders are perhaps most closely allied to the Droseraceæ
and agree with these, among other things, in the manner of
taking nourishment. Like the Droseraceæ they absorb nitrogenous
food from dissolved animal matter by means of their leaves,
which are specially constructed both to catch, to retain,
and to digest any small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span> animals which may be caught. The
<span class="smcap">Sarraceniaceæ</span> are North American marsh-plants (10
species) which have pitcher-like leaf-stalks, in the cavity of
which a fluid (with properties approaching those of gastric
juice) is secreted, and which bear at the apex a small, lid-like
blade; these leaf-stalks are the catching and digestive
organs.&mdash;<i>Sarracenia, Darlingtonia.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nepenthaceæ</span> has only 1 genus, <i>Nepenthes</i> (the
Pitcher-plant; about 35 species), especially found in tropical

twining organs, and terminate either simply in a tendril, or
in addition to this, with a pitcher-shaped body (which in some
species may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> as much as a foot in length) on whose upper edge
a lid-like structure is found (Fig. <a href="#fig420">420</a>). In this pitcher, as
among the Sarraceniaceæ, a fluid is secreted which is able to
digest the animals captured (sometimes rather large) and which
corresponds in some degree to the gastric juice.</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Violaceæ (Violets).</b> The flowers are ☿, and generally
zygomorphic, hypogynous, with S5, P5, A5, G3 (Fig. <a href="#fig421">421</a>). The stamens
are closely applied to the ovary, they have a very short filament,
and at their summit generally a membranous appendage formed by
the prolongation of the connective (Fig. <a href="#fig422">422</a> <i>g</i>). The ovary
is unilocular with 3 parietal placentæ; style undivided (Fig. <a href="#fig422">422</a>
<i>B</i>). The fruit is usually a 3-valved capsule, opening along the
dorsal sutures (Fig. <a href="#fig423">423</a>). Embryo straight; endosperm fleshy (Fig.

protrudes a considerable distance into the petaloid spur (Figs. <a href="#fig421">421</a>,
<a href="#fig422">422</a> <i>n</i>, <i>sp</i>). The style is club-like, and bears the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
stigma in a groove on the anterior side (Fig. <a href="#fig422">422</a> <i>st</i>). <span class="smaller">Herbs
with rhizomes, or annuals; flowers solitary. <i>V. odorata</i>,
<i>canina</i>, etc., have cleistogamic flowers which produce fruit in
addition to the large, coloured (violet) flowers. The Pansy (<i>V.
tricolor</i>) has large flowers adapted for insect-pollination, and
also smaller, less conspicuous ones designed for self-pollination. The
stigma, as in Fig. <a href="#fig422">422</a> <i>A</i>, <i>st</i>, and <i>B</i>, is situated
on the anterior side of the stylar-head, immediately in front of the
channel leading down to the spur (<i>sp</i>); below it is situated
a valve, easily covered with pollen when the proboscis of an insect
is introduced into the spur, but which closes upon its withdrawal;
cross-pollination is thus secured.&mdash;The sweet-scented <i>V. odorata</i>
is visited by the honey-bee, which insures cross-pollination, and
in the absence of insect visits it effects self-fertilisation by
cleistogamic flowers. The conspicuous but scentless <i>V. tricolor</i>,
var. <i>vulgaris</i>, is less frequently visited by insects
(humble-bees). In <i>V. silvatica</i> and <i>V. canina</i> the pollen
is carried on the head or proboscis of the honey-sucking bee.&mdash;The
fruits of <i>V. odorata</i> bury themselves slightly in the soil. In
the others the fruits are raised above the ground; the 3 boat-shaped
valves close together along the central line, and eject the seeds,
one by one, with much violence, so that they are thrown to a great
distance.</span></p>

5 small scales (Fig. <a href="#fig427">427</a>), or is altogether absent (<i>Hypericum
calycinum</i>, <i>H. hircinum</i>), and the inner divided
into numerous stamens, that is, these 5 stamens are so deeply
divided that 5 <i>epipetalous</i> groups bearing anthers are
found (as in the Cistaceæ); in other cases the flower becomes
<i>3-merous after the petals</i>, stamens 3 + 3 following in
regular alternation (Figs. <a href="#fig426">426</a>, <a href="#fig427">427</a>), the outer whorl of stamens

<h4>Family 12. <b>Gruinales.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers are hypogynous, ☿, polypetalous, usually
regular (except <i>Pelargonium</i>, <i>Tropæolaceæ</i>,
<i>Balsaminaceæ</i>) and <i>throughout 5-merous</i>: S5, P5, A5
+ 5, or 5 + 0, G5 (<i>epipetalous</i>). The stamens soon fall
off and are <i>obdiplostemonous</i>, often united at the base
(<i>monadelphous</i>); the corolla-stamens are in some completely
suppressed (<i>e.g. Balsaminaceæ</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig438">438</a>), in others
reduced to teeth (<i>Linum</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig431">431</a>; <i>Erodium</i>). The
<i>Tropæolaceæ</i> have 3 carpels and only 8 stamens (Fig. <a href="#fig437">437</a>).
Ring-like nectaries are not present, but at most only glandular bodies,
borne outside the base of the stamens. Ovaries many-locular. The
ovules as a rule are pendulous, with the micropyle directed outwards
(Fig. <a href="#fig431">431</a>, B), and the radicle therefore also points outwards. Usually
<i>herbs</i>. Related to the Columniferæ.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Oxalidaceæ.</b> Most of the species are herbs with
rhizomes; the leaves are stalked, <i>compound</i>, with entire leaflets
which are folded and bent backwards in the bud (and in the sleep
position), exstipulate; some species have sensitive leaves. The flowers
(Fig. <a href="#fig429">429</a>) are regular, and have S5, P5, which are <i>twisted</i>
to the left or right in æstivation, A5 + 5, all united at the base
(monadelphous), gynœceum 5-carpellate, <i>styles 5 free</i>, stigmas
capitate, ovary 5-locular, ovules numerous. The fruit is a <i>capsule
opening</i> with clefts <i>on the dorsal sutures</i> through which the
seeds are ejected, while the <i>fleshy, external layer of the testa</i>
springs off elastically. Embryo straight. Endosperm.</p>

scorpioid cymes. The pollination is effected by insects. Some
species are trimorphic (long-, short-, medium-styled flowers)
and some, <i>e.g. O. acetosella</i>, have cleistogamic
flowers in addition to the ordinary ones. Glands are found on
the outer side of the corolla-stamens or of all the stamens.

in a flower; and the succeeding branching is cymose, or unipared
scorpioid branching by unilateral development, and the flowers in
consequence of the vigorous sympodial development of the lateral axis
(and also by the leaves being displaced and pushed aside), assume a
position apparently lateral (<i>i.e.</i> racemose) without bracts;
each branch of the sympodium generally has 2 leaves. The testa is

<p>Order 3. <b>Geraniaceæ.</b> The majority are herbs with dichasial
branching, and scattered or opposite, stalked, <i>palminerved</i>
(rarely penninerved) leaves with small <i>stipules</i>. The flowers are
regular (except <i>Pelargonium</i>) and 5-merous, with 10 or 5 stamens,
which are slightly united at the base. Nectaries alternate with the
corolla-stamens. The ovary is most frequently 5-locular, deeply
5-grooved, and bears 1 <i>well developed style</i> (“beak”), which
towards the apex divides into 5 branches bearing stigmas; ovules 1 in
each loculus, pendulous or ascending. <i>The 5 carpels become detached
from one another when ripe</i>, and bend or <i>roll back</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig434">434</a>)
or become <i>spirally twisted</i> in the upper “beak-like” part (Figs.
<a href="#fig435">435</a>, <a href="#fig436">436</a>), whilst a <i>central column</i> (septal column) persists;
each carpel, in consequence, remains either closed, and the fruit is a
5-merous <i>schizocarp</i> whose nut-like lower portion, containing the
seed, is forced into the ground, thus burying the seed by the movements
of the spirally-twisted, hygroscopic “beak” (Figs. <a href="#fig435">435</a>, <a href="#fig436">436</a>); or it
opens along the ventral suture, so that the seeds may fall out, and it
is then a 5-valved <i>capsule</i>, with septicidal dehiscence (Fig.
<a href="#fig434">434</a>) and the rolling up often takes place so suddenly and violently
that the seeds are shot out to considerable distances. The embryo is
usually green and <i>curved</i>, and the <i>cotyledons are folded</i>;
endosperm is wanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span></p>

<p><i>Geranium</i> (Crane’s-bill) has 5 + 5 stamens,and a septicidal

flowers are situated solitarily or 2 together (2-flowered scorpioid
cyme).&mdash;<i>Erodium</i> (Stork’s-bill); inflorescence a many-flowered
unipared scorpioid cyme, stamens 5 + 0 (petal-stamens are wanting),

apparently only 3 petals, since the lateral and the posterior petals
become united in pairs, and the anterior is larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span> and differently
shaped; the 5 stamens have very short and thick filaments united at
the base, and their anthers finally adhere together and remain in
this condition, covering over the gynœceum; the filaments ultimately
rupture at the base, and the entire anthers are raised on the apex of
the gynœceum as it grows up. The gynœceum has a <i>sessile stigma</i>
and a 5-locular ovary. The fruit is a capsule which, on maturity, opens
suddenly when irritated, dividing into valves from the base upwards,

suppressed, often altogether wanting, or replaced by 5 staminodes,
while <i>the other</i> (inner whorl) <i>is generally divided more
or less deeply</i> into a large number of anther-bearing filaments.
The filaments too (except <i>Tiliaceæ</i>) are <i>united into a
tube</i>, which, especially in the <i>Malvaceæ</i>, forms a long
column in the centre of the flower, surrounding the gynœceum (Figs.
<a href="#fig445">445</a>, <a href="#fig448">448</a>); in this case, which is the most pronounced, the filaments
are united into one bundle (<i>monadelphous</i>), in other instances,
<i>polyadelphous</i>. The number of carpels varies greatly (2 to
about 50), but they are nearly always united and form a syncarpous
multilocular gynœceum.&mdash;The vegetative characters also closely agree,
the leaves <i>are always scattered and generally stipulate</i>; all
the green portions very often bear <i>stellate hairs</i>, and the
bark in all the 3 orders is <i>rich in tough bast</i>. Mucilage is

<i>4-locular, extrorse</i> anthers. The calyx-stamens are nearly always
simple, tooth-like staminodes, situated on the edge of the tube, or
are entirely suppressed. The same relation is found, for instance,
in the Ampelidaceæ and Rhamnaceæ, namely <i>5 stamens in front of
the 5 petals</i>; not infrequently the 5 stamens are doubled (Fig.
<a href="#fig441">441</a>). Unisexual flowers are found in <i>Sterculia</i>, <i>Cola</i>,
<i>Heritiera</i>. The corolla is often wanting, or developed in an
unusual manner. Each loculus of the ovary (generally 5) always contains
more than one ovule. Fruit a capsule. Androgynophore often present
(<i>Helicteres</i>; <i>Sterculia</i>, etc.).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hermannia</i>, <i>Mahernia</i>, <i>Melochia</i>,
etc., have flat petals with twisted æstivation; 5
undivided stamens, which usually are but slightly united
at the base, and most frequently, without staminodes.
<i>Thomasia</i>; <i>Helicteres</i>; <i>Sterculia</i>
(free follicles).&mdash;<i>Theobroma</i>, <i>Rulingia</i>,
<i>Buettneria</i>, <i>Commersonia</i>, <i>Guazuma</i>, etc., have
petals concave at the base, and terminating in a limb abruptly
bent back, and at the boundary between them most frequently
ligular outgrowths, as in certain genera of the Caryophyllaceæ;
stamens 5–15–∞, anthers at the edge of a short tube and 5 linear
staminodes (Fig. <a href="#fig441">441</a>).&mdash;The Cocoa-tree (<i>Theobroma</i>), (Fig.
<a href="#fig440">440</a>) bears large, reddish-yellow, berry-like fruits, resembling
short cucumbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span> but ultimately becoming leathery to woody;
in each of the 5 loculi are 2 (apparently only 1) rows of
horizontal, oily seeds, as large as almonds. Cotyledons large,
thick, and irregularly folded. Endosperm absent (Fig. <a href="#fig442">442</a>).</p>

<p>49 genera, with about 750 species; almost entirely confined to
the Tropics; none in Europe or in N. Asia.&mdash;The seeds of the
Cocoa-tree (<i>T. cacao</i>, <i>bicolor</i>, <i>glaucum</i>,
etc., natives of Trop. Am., especially north of the Equator) are
used for chocolate and are also <i>officinal</i> (“Cocoa-beans,”
“Cocoa-butter,” “Oil of Theobroma”). Theobromine. <i>Cola

<p>Order 2. <b>Tiliaceæ.</b> This differs from the other orders of the
Columniferæ chiefly in the stamens being entirely <i>free</i> from each
other, and also <i>divided</i> into many filaments, <i>as far as the
base</i>, or at all events very far down, so that the <i>flower appears
to have numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span> stamens</i> or to be <i>slightly</i> polyadelphous
(Fig. <a href="#fig443">443</a>); in addition to this, it may be observed that the anthers
are <i>4-locular</i> and <i>introrse</i>. In <i>Luehea</i> the groups of
stamens alternate with the petals. In a few genera (<i>Corchorus</i>,
<i>Triumfetta</i>) 10 free and single stamens are found in 2 whorls;
but, in the majority, groups of free stamens in separate bundles. The
stamens are more or less united in <i>Apeiba, Luehea</i>. Style simple.
Ovary 2-locular. The ovules are pendulous; raphe turned inwards. The
calyx readily falls off; the æstivation of the entirely free petals is
slightly imbricate (<i>not twisted</i>).</p>

<p><i>Tilia</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig443">443</a>, <a href="#fig444">444</a>). Calyx and corolla 5-merous; the 5
staminal leaves (opposite the petals) divided as far as the base into a
large number of stamens which are free or united into groups; gynœceum
with 5 loculi in the ovary (opposite the sepals); there are 2 ovules
in each loculus, though the ovary ripens into a 1-seeded nut, which
is not detached from the axis of the inflorescence, but is carried
away by the wind, whirling round and round, its large-winged bracteole
serving as a parachute (Fig. <a href="#fig443">443</a>).&mdash;<span class="smaller">Only trees, with alternate,
obliquely heart-shaped and dentate leaves; stellate hairs, as in the
other Columniferæ, are often present. The terminal bud of the branch
always fails to develop, and the growth is then continued sympodially
by the uppermost axillary buds. The <span class="allsmcap">INFLORESCENCE</span> (Figs.
<a href="#fig443">443</a>, <a href="#fig444">444</a>) is a 3–7-flowered dichasium (Fig. <a href="#fig444">444</a> <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>), which is developed in the axil of a foliage-leaf (Fig. <a href="#fig444">444</a>).
The first of its 2 bracteoles (<i>a</i>) is large, thin, leaf-like,
and united with the inflorescence, the lower portion of which forms a
broad wing, its so-called “bract”; the second bracteole (<i>b</i>), on
the other hand, remains scale-like, and supports a winter foliage-bud
covered with bud-scales which thus is situated at the base<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span> of the
inflorescence, and is a bud of the 2nd order, in relation to the
vegetative shoot. This bud is always found beneath the inflorescence
on the branch placed horizontally, and the winged bracteole is always
found above it, a relation which is connected with the fact that the
2 rows of shoots on the sides of a branch are <i>antidromous</i> with
regard to each other.&mdash;The dichasium itself (Fig. <a href="#fig444">444</a>) terminates with
the flower (<i>t</i>); it has 3 floral-leaves (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>), which soon fall off; <i>c</i> is barren: the other two
bear flowers, or few-flowered dichasia, or unipared scorpioid cymes
(indicated in the figure).&mdash;The foliage-leaves are folded in the bud
upon the median line (1, 2, 3 in Fig. <a href="#fig444">444</a> are foliage-leaves with
their 2 stipules), the inner half is broader than the outer, and after
unfolding is turned away from the mother-axis (the position of the new

<p>Order 3. <b>Malvaceæ</b> (<b>Mallows</b>). The plants are easily
recognised by the scattered, simple, <i>palminerved</i>, most
frequently lobed, stipulate <i>leaves</i>, folded in the bud; the
perfect, regular, hypogynous flowers, with <i>gamosepalous</i>,
persistent, 5-merous calyx<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span> with <i>valvate</i> æstivation; the 5

<a href="#fig448">448</a>), with the filaments <i>united into a tube</i>, with <i>reniform
bilocular anthers</i> opening by a crescentic slit (in 2 valves).
Carpels 3–∞ united into one gynœceum; the <i>embryo is curved and the
cotyledons are folded</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig447">447</a>, <a href="#fig451">451</a>); endosperm scanty, often

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An <i>epicalyx</i> is often found formed by <i>floral-leaves</i>
placed close beneath the calyx, in some 3, in others several.
The median sepal is posterior in the species without epicalyx,
often anterior in those which have an epicalyx.&mdash;The petals are
<i>twisted either to the right or to the left</i> in accordance
with the spiral of the calyx; they are most frequently oblique,
as in the other plants with twisted corollas, so that the
portion covered in the æstivation is the most developed.
The corolla drops off as a whole, united with the staminal
tube.&mdash;Only the 5 petal-stamens are developed, but they are
divided into a number of stamens, placed in 2 rows, and provided
only with <i>half</i>-anthers (leaf-segments, see Fig. <a href="#fig446">446</a>;
the sepal-stamens are completely suppressed); these 5 staminal
leaves are then united into a tube, frequently 5-dentate at
the top, and bearing the anthers on its external side. The
pollen-grains are specially large, spherical and spiny. There
are from 3 to about 50 carpels united into one gynœceum and
placed round the summit of the axis which most frequently
projects between them. There is only 1 style, which is generally
divided into as many stigma-bearing branches as there are
carpels (Figs. <a href="#fig445">445</a>, <a href="#fig448">448</a>). The fruit is a schizocarp or capsule.
Endosperm (Figs. <a href="#fig447">447</a> A, <a href="#fig451">451</a>) scanty, often mucilaginous round
the <i>embryo</i>, which is rich in oil.</p>

<p>The order is the most advanced type of Columniferæ; it stands
especially near to the Sterculiaceæ, but is separated from these
and from the Tiliaceæ, among other characters, by its 2-locular
(ultimately 1-chambered) anthers.</p>
</div>

<p>The sub-orders may be arranged as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span></p>

<p>I. Carpels in one whorl.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> <b>The fruit a capsule</b>, <span class="smaller">most frequently with

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">Gossypieæ.</span> The staminal-column is naked at the apex,
blunted, or 5-dentate.&mdash;<i>Gossypium</i> (the Cotton plant) has an
epicalyx of 3 large ovate-cordate leaves, an almost entire, low and
compressed calyx. Solitary flowers. Large, most frequently yellow,
corollas. A 3–5-valved capsule with many spherical seeds. “Cotton” is
the seed-hairs developed upon the entire surface of the seeds (Fig.
<a href="#fig447">447</a>), and consists of long, 1-cellular hairs, filled with air (and
therefore white); these are thin-walled, with a large lumen, and during
drying twist spirally, and come together more or less in the form of
bands. They consist of cellulose, and have a cuticle.&mdash;<i>Hibiscus</i>
has several, most frequently narrow, epicalyx-leaves, a distinct
5-toothed or 5-partite calyx.&mdash;<i>Abutilon</i>; <i>Modiola</i>.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">Bombaceæ.</span> The staminal tube is more or
less deeply cleft into bundles, sometimes almost to the base;
pollen smooth, style simple with capitate, lobed stigma. Almost
all plants belonging to this group are trees, and in many
instances have large barrel-shaped stems, that is, swollen in
the centre, and sometimes covered with large warts. The wood is
exceptionally light and soft. The flowers are often enormously
large, and have beautiful petals; in some they unfold before
the leaves. The capsule-wall is sometimes closely covered on
its inner service with long, silky, woolly hairs, while the
seeds themselves are generally without hairs. These hairs,
however, on account of their brittle nature, cannot be used
like those of the Cotton-plant. Digitate leaves are found in
the <i>Baobab-tree</i> (<i>Adansonia</i>) from Africa, noted
for its enormously thick, but short stem, and in the American
<i>Silk-cotton trees</i> (<i>Bombax</i>, <i>Eriodendron</i>,
<i>Chorisia</i>). <i>Ochroma</i>, <i>Cheirostemon</i>,
<i>Durio</i>, and others also belong to this group. <i>Durio</i>
is noted for its delicious fruits, which have a most unpleasant
smell.</p>

<p>[<i>Bombax malabaricum</i> is diplostemonous; the five
sepal-stamens repeatedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span> branch, and the filaments bear
unilocular anthers; the five petal-stamens bear bilocular

an antidromous flower which continues the branching as a unipared
scorpioid cyme.&mdash;<i>Althæa</i>, Rose Mallow, has an <i>epicalyx of

in 1 whorl, with 1 ovule in each loculus, and the fruit
a schizocarp, generally with nut-like fruitlets provided
with warts and hooks; but in some they dehisce by 2 valves
(capsule). They differ principally from the other groups <i>in
having twice as many stylar-branches as carpels</i>; the
staminal tube is naked at the point, blunt or 5 toothed.&mdash;The
genera <i>Urena</i>, <i>Pavonia</i>, <i>Malachra</i>,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>5.</b> <span class="smcap">Malopeæ</span>, differ from all the others in

before maturity; there is, however, only 1 style, divided into
a corresponding number of branches (this condition may be
considered to have arisen from the branching [dédoublement]
of 5 <i>carpels</i>). <i>Malope</i> has 3 large, heart-shaped
(<i>Kitaibelia</i> 6–9) epicalyx-leaves, united at the base.
<i>Palava</i> has no epicalyx.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> The majority have protandrous flowers,
and are pollinated by insects. Between the basal portions of
the 5 petals, there are 5 nectaries, protected from the rain
by hairs, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Malva silvestris</i>. When the
flower first opens the numerous anthers occupy the centre of the
flower, and the still undeveloped stigmas are concealed in the
staminal tube; in the next stage the anthers are withered and
empty, and the stigmas protrude and assume their places (Fig.
<a href="#fig452">452</a>). The large-flowered forms, it appears, are pollinated only
by insects; but self-pollination takes place in small-flowered
forms, as, for example, in <i>Malva rotundifolia</i>, in which
the stylar-branches, twisting themselves, place the stigmas in
between the undeveloped anthers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distribution.</span> 800 species (63 genera), most of which
are natives of the Tropics, especially America. <i>Althæa</i>
and some of the species of <i>Malva</i> are natives of the
temperate regions of the Old World, the latter is also found in
North America. <i>Gossypium</i> is tropical, no doubt especially
Asiatic (<i>G. herbaceum</i> from India; <i>G. arboreum</i> from
Upper Egypt). Cotton was introduced into Greece in the time of
Herodotus, and was cultivated in America before the arrival of
the Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Pungent and poisonous properties are entirely
wanting; <i>mucilage</i>, on the other hand, is found
in abundance in all parts of the plant. Medicinal: the
root of <i>Althæa officinalis</i>, leaves and flowers of
<i>Malva</i>-species (<i>M. silvestris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span> vulgaris</i> and
<i>borealis</i>) and <i>Gossypium</i>.&mdash;The seeds contain a
large quantity of <i>fatty oil</i>, which is in some cases
extracted (Cotton-seeds and others). <i>The seed-hairs of the
Cotton plant</i> are the most important product of the order.
The cultivated forms of Cotton belong to several species:
<i>G. barbadense</i>, <i>herbaceum</i>, <i>religiosum</i>,
<i>arboreum</i> (Nankin), <i>hirsutum</i>, and others. According
to other botanists, there are only 3 species. <i>Bast</i>
is obtained from <i>e.g. Hibiscus cannabinus</i>
(Gambo-hemp, Africa), <i>Paritium tiliaceum</i> and <i>Sida
retusa</i>. The fruits of certain species of <i>Hibiscus</i>
(<i>e.g. H. esculentus</i>, from Tropical Africa)
are used in tropical countries as a vegetable before they
are ripe.&mdash;<i>The colouring matter</i> in the flowers of
<i>Althæa rosea</i>, var. <i>nigra</i>, is used for colouring
wines, and hence is extensively cultivated in certain parts
of Europe.&mdash;<i>Ethereal oils and sweet-scented flowers</i>
are rare; but several species possess a peculiar musk-like
odour (<i>Malva moschata</i>, <i>Hibiscus abelmoschus</i>,
and others).&mdash;Many are cultivated as <i>ornamental plants</i>
on account of the large flowers, <i>e.g.</i> Hollyhock (<i>A.
rosea</i>, etc.), <i>Lavatera trimestris</i>, <i>Malope
grandiflora</i> and <i>trifida</i>, <i>Malva</i>-species,
<i>Hibiscus rosa sinensis</i>, <i>syriaca</i>;

frequently regular flowers, the perianth most frequently single, rarely
double, or entirely wanting; there is such a great variety in the
structure and parts of the flower that one only can be cited as the
<i>rule</i>: viz. the simple gynœceum composed of 3 carpels forming a
3-locular ovary, which is frequently more or less deeply grooved (hence
the name, <i>Tricoccæ</i>); in the inner angles of the loculi are found
1 or 2 (never several) pendulous (except <i>Empetraceæ</i>), anatropous
ovules, with upward and outwardly turned, frequently swollen, micropyle
(Fig. <a href="#fig455">455</a>). The seed most frequently has a large endosperm and a
straight embryo (Figs. <a href="#fig455">455</a> <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig464">464</a>).&mdash;<span class="smaller">The family approaches
the nearest to the Gruinales and Columniferæ; it may perhaps be
regarded as an offshoot from the Sterculiaceæ.</span></p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Euphorbiaceæ.</b> Flowers unisexual. In each of the loculi
of the ovary, generally 3, there are 1 or 2 pendulous ovules with
upward and outwardly turned micropyle. The placenta protrudes above the
ovules (Figs. <a href="#fig454">454</a>, <a href="#fig461">461</a> <i>B</i>). On the ripening of the capsule the 3
carpels separate septicidally, frequently with great violence, ejecting
the seeds and leaving a central column. Endosperm copious.&mdash;For the
rest, the flowers present all stages, from genera with calyx and
corolla, to those which are the most reduced in Nature, namely the
naked, 1-stamened flowers of <i>Euphorbia</i>.</p>

<p>The same variety which is found in the flower is also present in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span> the
vegetative parts. Some are herbs, as our Spurges, others are shrubs and
trees; some African <i>Euphorbia</i>-species even resemble the habit
of a Cactus. Leaf-like branches with rudimentary leaves are found in
<i>Phyllanthus</i> (sub-genus <i>Xylophylla</i>) (Fig. <a href="#fig456_458">456</a>). The leaves
are scattered or opposite, often stipulate; they are nearly always
simple. Large, highly-branched cells containing a great quantity of
pungent latex are found in many, and watery juice in others. Glands and
glandular hairs are general.&mdash;Only a few genera can be considered in
this book.</p>

<p>As an example of the most perfect flowers (which partly reproduce the
Geraniaceous type) may be mentioned, <i>Croton</i>, <i>Manihot</i>, and
<i>Jatropha</i>; 5 sepals, 5 petals, sometimes gamopetalous, andrœcium
diplostemonous, or many-stamened, often monodelphous.</p>

<p><i>Euphorbia</i> (Spurge) has the most reduced flowers, which are
borne in a very complicated inflorescence. Each ♂-flower (Fig. <a href="#fig460">460</a>
<i>B</i>) is naked, and consists of one stamen only (terminal on the
axis). In the closely allied genus <i>Anthostema</i>, a small perianth
is situated at the place where, in <i>Euphorbia</i>, there is a joint
in the “filament,” (Fig. <a href="#fig461">461</a> <i>A</i>). The ♀-flowers (Fig. <a href="#fig460">460</a>) are
naked, with a 3-locular ovary and 3 bifid styles. (<i>Anthostema</i>
has a distinct perianth (Fig. <a href="#fig461">461</a> <i>B</i>); in a few Euphorbias traces
of a perianth are present). In <i>Euphorbia</i> the ♂-and ♀-flowers are
grouped into flower-like inflorescences termed “cyathia.” Each cyathium
consists of a centrally placed ♀-flower which is first developed,
surrounded by 5 groups of ♂-flowers (stamens) placed in a zig-zag, with
a centrifugal order of development (Figs. <a href="#fig459">459</a>, <a href="#fig460">460</a> <i>B</i>), that
is, in unipared scorpioid cymes; these flowers are surrounded by an
<i>involucre</i> of 5 leaves united into a <i>bell-shaped structure</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig459">459</a>, 1–5) (resembling a calyx); on its edge are placed 4,
generally crescent-like, yellow glands, one in each of the intervals,
except one, between the lobes of the involucre (shaded in Fig. <a href="#fig459">459</a>; see
also Fig. <a href="#fig460">460</a> <i>A</i>). Scale-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span> thin structures (floral-leaves?)
are situated between the ♂-flowers. The ♀-flower has a long stalk, and
finally bends down on one side, namely to the place on the edge of the
involucre where the gland is not developed. These cyathia are again
arranged in an inflorescence which commences as a 3–5-rayed umbellate
cyme (pleiochasium), the branches of which ramify dichasially and
finally as scorpioid cymes.&mdash;Latex, with peculiar-shaped starch-grains,
is found in laticiferous <i>cells</i> (especially in the Cactus-like,
leafless species.)</p>

form a rosette in the apex of the branches. The flowers are
unisexual (monœcious) and borne singly in the leaf-axils; they

the ♂-flowers consist of only <i>1 terminal stamen</i> (Fig.

<h4>Family 15. <b>Terebinthinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The diagram of the flower (Figs. <a href="#fig465">465–467</a>) is the same as in the
Gruinales, namely S, P, A2 and G in whorls of 5 (less frequently 3,
4, 6, 8), and the same modifications also occur with the suppression
of the petal-stamens, etc. But a <i>ring</i> or sometimes <i>cup-like
glandular structure</i> (<i>disc</i>) is found <i>between</i> the
andrœcium and the gynœceum (Figs. <a href="#fig465">465</a>, <a href="#fig466">466</a>). The flowers similarly
are regular, <i>hypogynous</i>, ☿ and polypetalous, though exceptions
are found to all these characters: thus, for example, united sepals
and petals frequently occur, and, in some orders, unisexual flowers
by the suppression of one sex. In most cases the flowers are small,
greenish-yellow, and arranged in paniculate inflorescences. The
carpels (most frequently 5) are free in a few, but generally united
into a multilocular gynœceum; rarely more than 1 or 2 ovules in each
loculus. The gynœceum in the Anacardiaceæ is so reduced that it has
only 1 fertile loculus with 1 ovule.&mdash;The <i>ovules are epitropous</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> anatropous with outward-turned raphe (except the
Anacardiaceæ).&mdash;The majority of the species are trees and shrubs with
scattered, often <i>compound (pinnate) leaves</i> without stipules,
and as in addition they frequently contain <i>aromatic, especially
turpentine-like substances</i>, they assume a certain resemblance to
the Walnut trees, and were formerly classed with them mainly on this
account. In a series of genera the volatile, scented oils are found in
special glands in the bark of the branches and in the leaves, in the
latter case appearing as <i>pellucid dots</i>. This family includes
several orders which are somewhat difficult to distinguish from each
other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Connaraceæ.</b> This order forms the connecting
link between Terebinthinæ and Rosifloræ (<i>Spiræa</i>) as
well as Leguminosæ, with which they are sometimes classed.
The flowers have 5 5-merous whorls; 2 ovules in each loculus;
micropyle turned upwards. Fruit a <i>follicle</i>, rarely a
collection of follicles. Seed with aril. Shrubs with scattered
(most frequently pinnate) leaves, without stipules. 170 species.
Tropical.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Meliaceæ.</b> Trees and shrubs with scattered,
often pinnate leaves without pellucid dots and exstipulate; the
leaflets are nearly always entire. Flowers small in paniculate
inflorescences. Calyx and corolla 4–5-merous; 2 whorls of
stamens; 3–5 carpels in the gynœceum. A very characteristic
feature is the union of the filaments into a tube, on the
edge of which stipule-like teeth are often found. There are
most frequently 2 ovules in the loculi;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span> fruit a capsule with
many winged seeds in <i>Swietenia</i> (Mahogany tree; Trop.
Am.), <i>Cedrela</i>, etc.; berries in others. The wood of
<i>Cedrela</i> is used for making cigar boxes. 550 species;
tropical.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Rutaceæ.</b> Leaves glandular with pellucid dots. The type
is the same as that of the family. Flowers 4–5-merous. The ovary is
most frequently 4–5-grooved. Disc well pronounced, often appearing as
a “gynophore.” The majority are shrubs with alternate or opposite,
compound, more rarely simple, leaves.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> The ovary is deeply 2–5-cleft with basal styles which are
more or less united; the carpels in some genera are entirely free
(groups 1, 2). The fruit is capsular and most frequently dehisces like
follicles along the ventral suture or septicidally, so that a horn-like
internal layer (endocarp) separates elastically from the external layer.</p>

one whorl of stamens which are split irregularly into several bundles
(Fig. <a href="#fig470">470</a>). The fruit is a <i>multilocular berry</i> provided with a
thick, tough, outer layer. The juicy pulp, which fills up the loculi
and envelopes the seeds, is formed from many large-celled, juicy
hair-structures which arise on the inner side of the walls of the
loculi and by degrees entirely fill them up; the dissepiments remain
thin, and form the partitions so easily separating from each other
(Fig. <a href="#fig469">469</a>). The seeds in many instances are remarkable for containing
several embryos. The blade of the leaf is separated from the frequently
winged stalk by a <i>node</i> (and hence is a compound leaf with only

<h4>Family 16. <b>Aesculinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The essential characters of this family are in the main the same as
those of the Terebinthinæ and Gruinales. The flowers are hypogynous,
perfect, with free petals, 5-merous (S5, P5, typically A5 + 5, all of
which, however, are not generally developed; in our native orders there
are only 7–8 stamens), and most frequently a <i>3-merous, 3-locular
gynœceum</i> (less frequently 2 or 5 carpels with as many loculi). In
each loculus there are usually only 1–2 ovules. A deviation from the
preceding families is the frequent <i>zygomorphy</i> of the flower,
with, as a rule an <i>oblique</i> plane of symmetry (Fig. <a href="#fig471">471</a>). When a
<i>disc</i> is developed it is placed <i>outside</i> the stamens. The
majority have no endosperm (Fig. <a href="#fig473">473</a>).&mdash;The members of the family are
nearly all trees.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The family is closely allied to the Terebinthinæ, but unlike
this it never has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span> aromatic properties, and differs also
in the position of the nectary, in the flowers, which are
often irregular with a reduction in the number of stamens,
and in the ovule which is usually ascending with micropyle
pointing downwards (the Terebinthinæ having the micropyle
turned upwards), etc. It is also related to Frangulinæ, the
Staphyleaceæ being the chief connecting link; but the Æsculinæ
generally have compound leaves.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Staphyleaceæ.</b> Leaves opposite, often compound.
Flowers regular, ☿, 5-merous in calyx and corolla, 5-stamened.
The stamens are placed <i>outside</i> the nectary. Ovary
syncarpous or 2–3-partite with free styles. The capsule is
thin, bladder-like, 2–3-locular, opening at the apex, and
has several very hard seeds with a shining testa without
aril. Endosperm. <i>Staphylea pinnata</i> (S. Europe) and
<i>trifoliata</i> (N. Am.) are cultivated in gardens; they have
white flowers in pendulous, axillary racemes or panicles.&mdash;16
species.&mdash;<i>Staphylea</i> is found in the Tertiary of N.
America.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Melianthaceæ.</b> Glaucous shrubs with scattered,
pinnate leaves, and large stipules. <i>Melianthus.</i>&mdash;8
species; S. Africa.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Sapindaceæ.</b> Trees or shrubs, often climbing by tendrils
(lianes with anomalous structure of the stem) and with compound leaves.
The flowers, in most cases, are small, insignificant, and without
scent, and in some polygamous and zygomorphic. S4–5, P4–5, A8 (less
frequently 5–10) inside the nectary (disc); ovary generally 3-locular,
with 1–2 ovules in each loculus (raphe ventral, micropyle turned
downwards). Seed without endosperm, often with an aril. The embryo is
often thick and curved (Fig. <a href="#fig473">473</a>).</p>

5 free petals, of which the one lying between S<sup>3</sup> and S<sup>5</sup> is the
smallest (see Fig. <a href="#fig471">471</a>) and may be absent; stamens 7 (5 + 2), three
being suppressed; gynœceum simple, 3-carpellary and 3-locular, with
single style; of the two ovules one is ascending, the other descending
(Fig. <a href="#fig472">472</a>).&mdash;The fruit is a 3-valvate, sometimes spiny, capsule,
with loculicidal dehiscence, the seed having a large hilum, a curved
embryo without endosperm and united cotyledons (the radicle lies in
a fold of the testa, Fig. <a href="#fig473">473</a>). <i>Æ. hippocastanum</i> (Greece,

be absent or present. The flowers in almost all the orders are
<i>small, green or whitish</i>; they are <i>always regular</i>,
4-<i>or</i> 5-<i>merous</i> with 2–5 <i>carpels</i>, but never have
more than 1 <i>whorl of stamens</i>, which in <i>Rhamnaceæ</i> and
<i>Ampelidaceæ</i> are placed <i>opposite</i> the petals (typically 5
+ 5 or 4 + 4 stamens, of which however either the external or internal
whorl is always wanting); hypogynous or slightly perigynous, in
<i>Rhamnaceæ</i> only strongly perigynous or epigynous; generally ☿;
the calyx is inconspicuous; petals free or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span> slightly united. Gynœceum
simple; <i>ovary generally multilocular</i>; style short or entirely
wanting. A <i>disc</i> is nearly always developed in the flower, but
is found sometimes inside the staminal whorl, sometimes outside it or
between the stamens. The ovules are apotropous (anatropous with dorsal
or ventral raphe).</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Celastraceæ.</b> <i>Euonymus europæa</i> (Spindle-tree)

5-) merous in regular alternation. There is a <i>thick disc</i> upon
which the polypetalous corolla (imbricate in the bud) and the stamens
are borne, with a slightly perigynous insertion. The style is short and
thick; the ovary has 2 <i>erect</i> ovules in each loculus. The fruit
is a red, 4-valvate capsule with loculicidal dehiscence; the seeds are
few in number, and have a large, red-yellow <i>aril</i> (developed from

<p>Order 3. <b>Aquifoliaceæ (Hollies).</b> The genus <i>Ilex</i> forms
almost the entire order. (175 species out of 180; especially from S.

regular alternation; the calyx and <i>corolla</i> have their leaves
<i>slightly</i> connate;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span> stamens slightly adnate to the corolla; the
ovary is generally almost spherical with a thick, sessile stigma (Fig.

lobed, divided or compound. The small, greenish flowers are generally
borne in paniculate <i>inflorescences, whose position is the same as
that of the tendrils</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig478">478</a>); they are hypogynous or slightly
perigynous, ☿, with 4–5 sepals, petals, stamens (which, as in the
Rhamneæ, are <i>opposite the petals</i>; Fig. <a href="#fig480">480</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>)
and 2 carpels. The calyx is very small, entire, or slightly dentate;
corolla <i>valvate</i>, and in some falling off as a hood, since the
individual parts remain united at the summit (Fig. <a href="#fig480">480</a> <i>A</i>).
Between the stamens and gynœceum is situated an hypogynous <i>disc</i>,

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">TENDRILS</span> in Ampelidaceæ are modified branches,
since they bear leaves and may be abnormally developed as
branches with foliage-leaves, and finally the inflorescences
are borne in the position of the tendrils, and tendrils are met
with which are partly inflorescences. The explanation of the
position of the tendril, namely, right opposite the foliage-leaf
but without a subtending-leaf, has been much disputed. The
relative positions are as follows: in <i>Vitis vinifera</i>
the following two kinds of shoots and relative positions are
found (the other species deviate in one or other particular),
(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Long-branches</span>, which have 2 scale-leaves
and a large number of foliage-leaves with a divergence of
1/2;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> opposite the lowest 3–5 foliage-leaves no tendrils are
found, then follow: 2 foliage-leaves with tendrils, 1 without a
tendril, 2 with and 1 without, etc., with great regularity. Buds
are developed in the axils of the foliage-leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig479">479</a>):
these develop into (<i>b</i>) <span class="allsmcap">DWARF-BRANCHES</span>, which
commence with 1 laterally-placed scale-leaf (fore-leaf; Fig. <a href="#fig481">481</a>
<i>v</i>) succeeded by several foliage-leaves with a divergence
of 1/2 (in a plane at right angles to that of the mother-shoot),
but the whole shoot is extremely small, and often dries up
and drops off in the autumn, so that only the scale-leaf,
<i>v</i>, with the bud (Fig. <a href="#fig481">481</a> <i>lt<sub>1</sub></i>) in its axil
remains. This bud in the following year developes into a new
long-branch, and since its leaves lie in a plane at right angles
to that of the dwarf-branch, their plane coincides with that
of the long-branch from which it is developed (the grandmother
axis).&mdash;The tendrils no doubt may most correctly be regarded as
the modified main axis which has been pushed aside by a lateral
branch. The branches are then sympodia, whose successive shoots
bear alternately 1 and 2 foliage-leaves: thus, on the figure
there are portions altogether of 5 shoots (I.-V.), the 1-leaved
ones are shaded, the 2-leaved ones are white. The following
facts however are adverse to this theory: (1) the first leaf on
an axillary bud is then situated 180° from the subtending leaf
(<i>e.g.</i> the lowermost shaded leaf, Fig. <a href="#fig479">479</a>, 180° from the
lowermost white leaf), whilst the rule in the Dicotyledons is
that it is placed only about 90° to one side. (2) The buds (Fig.
<a href="#fig479">479</a> <i>K</i>) from which the dwarf-branches develop, must then
be accessory and sister-buds to the sympodial shoots, but their
first leaves have a different relative position to this, which
is very peculiar, and a still more remarkable fact is that the
buds, <i>K</i>, etc. are similar in structure and present in
<i>all the axils</i>; thus we <i>only</i> find accessory buds
in the cases where no tendrils are opposite to the leaves, and
the main bud must then be considered to be suppressed. (3) The
development proves that the tendrils arise on the side of a
vigorous growing-point of the stem or by its division, and do
not develop, as might be expected, from the apex of the shoot.
But these relations however, find their analogues and are all
capable of explanation, whereas other less natural modes of
explanation are opposed to them.</p>

are inconspicuous, sometimes unisexual (Fig. <a href="#fig482">482</a>), and have 5 (-4)
sepals, petals, stamens, and generally 3 (2–5) carpels. The calyx has
<i>valvate</i> æstivation. The petals are very <i>small</i> (generally

<h4>Family 18. <b>Thymelæinæ.</b></h4>

<p>Exclusively trees or shrubs with simple, entire, scattered leaves
without stipules. They have a <i>strongly perigynous</i>, regular,
<i>4-merous</i> flower. The receptacle (often coloured) envelopes
a simple gynœceum formed of <b>1</b> <i>carpel</i> and with, in
most cases, <b>1</b> ovule, bearing on its edge 4 (or 5) petaloid
sepals and, but rarely at the same time, small, scale-like petals.
The corolla is most frequently entirely wanting (and hence these
plants were formerly reckoned among the Monochlamydeæ); frequently
only one of the 2 whorls of stamens, which are situated on the inner
side of the edge of the receptacle, is developed. The fruit is most
frequently a <i>1-seeded</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span> berry or drupe, or a nut which may be
falsely berry-like, the partly persistent receptacle being fleshy and
enveloping it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This family appears the most nearly allied to the Frangulinæ,
especially the Rhamnaceæ, and may be considered as a further
development of these in the direction of the petaloid
development of the receptacle and reduction of the corolla and
gynœceum, which in this instance only consists of one carpel.
Another deviation is that both the whorls of stamens are
present, while one of these is always wanting in Frangulinæ.
They also appear to be related to the Lauraceæ (see page <a href="#Page_391">391</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Thymelæaceæ.</b> The flowers are most frequently ☿ (Fig.
<a href="#fig483">483</a>). The receptacle is high, generally tubular, coloured, and bears
on its edge the 4-(or 5)-merous calyx, with imbricate æstivation. The
corolla is wanting or is represented by small scales. The stamens are
situated on the inside of the receptacle, and number 4 + 4 (or 5 + 5);
stigma capitate. 1 <i>pendulous ovule</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig483">483</a> <i>B</i>), the
<i>radicle pointing upwards</i>. The fruit is most frequently a berry.
<span class="smaller">A disc is sometimes developed. Endosperm wanting or very slight.</span></p>

<p>Order 3 (?). <b>Proteaceæ.</b> This order has its chief centre
in the dry regions of Australia (6/10–7/10 of about 1,000
species), a smaller number in S. Africa (2/10–3/10). a few
species in S. Am. Trees or shrubs, leaves generally scattered,
without stipules, and more or less dry, leathery, evergreen,
and often of very different forms on the same plant (undivided,
compound, etc.) The flowers are ☿ (rarely unisexual), and
<i>4-merous</i> in the single, petaloid perianth and in
the staminal whorl; 1 carpel; sometimes zygomorphic. The
perianth-leaves are generally almost free, with <i>valvate</i>,
æstivation, often leathery. Small scales alternating with the
perianth are often found at the base of the ovary. The stamens
generally have extremely short filaments, and are situated
opposite, sometimes quite on the tip of the perianth-leaves, in
a spoon-like groove. The gynœceum is 1-locular, has 1–several
ovules, and is often raised on a stalk-like internode. The fruit
is a follicle or nut. The seeds, most frequently winged, have
no endosperm.&mdash;<i>Protea</i>, <i>Manglesia</i>, <i>Hakea</i>,
<i>Banksia</i>, <i>Grevillea</i>, etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span> 50 genera; about 1,000
species. Several species are cultivated in our conservatories
for the sake of the flowers, which are beautifully coloured and
arranged in crowded inflorescences. Protandrous. It is doubtful
whether they were existent in Europe in the Tertiary Period.
The true systematic position of the order is doubtful. They are
related to the Leguminosæ and Rosifloræ, but more closely no
doubt to the two preceding orders.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 19. <b>Saxifraginæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flower is generally perfect, regular and polypetalous, usually
<i>perigynous</i> or <i>epigynous</i>, <i>eucyclic</i> and 5-merous;
most frequently S5, P5, A5 + 5 or 5 + 0 and G<b>2</b>-5, but other
numbers are found, especially 4; the flowers are very frequently
obdiplostemonous. The calyx is sometimes large and the corolla small;
the carpels in some are entirely free, in others more or less united.
Endosperm is found in the majority. <span class="smaller">The hypogynous forms approach
the Cistifloræ, the others the following families, especially the
Rosifloræ. This family is not, upon the whole, so well defined and
natural as most of the others. The Saxifragaceæ proper, approach very
near to the Rosaceæ, especially <i>Spiræa</i>, and form a transition
to it. The forms with opposite leaves, as <i>Philadelphus</i>, etc.,
approach the Myrtifloræ, just as the Escalloniæ appear to be closely
allied to Bicornes, especially <i>Vacciniaceæ</i>. Finally through
<i>Pittosporaceæ</i>, they pass over to the Frangulinæ. The family
terminates in very reduced forms, on the one hand in the arborescent
orders with crowded inflorescences, on the other perhaps in the very
remarkable order <i>Podostemaceæ</i>.</span></p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Crassulaceæ.</b> Nearly all are herbs or small shrubs with
round, succulent branches and scattered, <i>fleshy</i>, often more

stipules. The flowers are generally borne in dichasia or unipared
scorpioid cymes, which again may be arranged in racemes, umbels, etc.;
they are regular, ☿, hypogynous or perigynous, and most frequently have
free sepals and petals (gamopetalous corollas with sessile stamens are

<p>The following genera are allied to the Saxifragaceæ:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <i>Parnassia</i> (about 14 species; <i>P. palustris</i>,

S5, P5, 5 fertile sepal-stamens, and 5 petal-stamens, which are
developed as barren staminodes, palmately-lobed, and (3–) 4
carpels united in a 1-locular ovary with (3–) 4 parietal placentæ.
Capsule.&mdash;<span class="smaller">Protandrous. The flower has a slightly oblique plane of
symmetry, which is especially shown during its development and in the
order of sequence in which the anthers dehisce: originally they lie
closely round the gynœceum; the anthers dehisce extrorsely, first
the one which is placed opposite the most external sepal (the 2/5
arrangement is very distinct in the calyx), the filament elongating so
that the anther lies over the ovary, and this is followed successively
by the 4 others in a zig-zag line; the filaments bend backwards after
the pollen is shed and the anthers drop off, and the stigmas are not
developed until this is completed. The barren stamens are palmately
divided into an uneven number (7, 9, 11) of lobes, tapering from the
centre towards the edge, and bearing apparently glandular tips; their
gland-like appearance is supposed to allure flies to visit the flower,
or they may act as a kind of fence which compels the insects to enter
the flower in a certain way, and thus effect pollination; the honey is
secreted on their inner side, and not by the gland-like tips.</span></p>

<h4>Family 20. <b>Rosifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The leaves are scattered, stipulate, or have at least a well developed
sheath, which is generally prolonged on each side into a free portion
(“adnate stipules”). The flowers are regular, <i>perigynous</i> or
<i>epigynous</i>. Calyx and corolla 5 (-4)-<i>merous</i> with the usual
position. The corolla is always polypetalous. The stamens are present
in very varying numbers (5–∞) and position, but <i>always</i> placed
in 5-<i>or</i> 10-<i>merous whorls</i>; they <i>are frequently</i> 20
in 3 whorls (10 + 5 + 5; see Figs. <a href="#fig494">494</a>, <a href="#fig502">502</a>, <a href="#fig505">505</a>); the nearer they are
placed to the circumference, the longer they are; they are generally
<i>incurved in the bud, or even rolled up</i>. The number of the
carpels is from 1–∞; in most cases all are <i>individually free</i>
(syncarp), and when they are united it is in every case with the
ovaries only, whilst the <i>styles</i> remain more or less <i>free</i>
(<i>Pomaceæ</i>, species of <i>Spiræa</i>). The <i>seeds</i> have a
straight embryo, and usually no endosperm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The perianth and stamens are most frequently <i>perigynous</i>
on the edge of the widened receptacle; its form varies between
a flat cupule and a long tube or a cup (Figs. <a href="#fig495">495</a>, <a href="#fig496">496</a>, <a href="#fig498">498</a>,
<a href="#fig499">499</a>, <a href="#fig500">500</a>); the carpels are situated on its base or inner
surface, in some instances on a central conical elongation of
the floral axis (Fig. <a href="#fig496">496</a>). The carpels in <i>Pomaceæ</i> also
unite more or less with the hollow receptacle, or this grows
in and fills up the space between the carpels, so that a more
or less epigynous flower is formed (Fig. <a href="#fig504">504</a>).&mdash;The following
numbers of <i>stamens</i> occur: 5, 10 (in 1 whorl), 15 (10
+ 5), 20 (10 + 5 + 5), 25 (10 + 10 + 5), 30-50 (in 10-merous
whorls)&mdash;compare the diagrams. The theoretical explanation of
this relation of the 10-merous whorls and their alternation with
the 5-merous whorls is not definitely determined; a splitting
of the members of the 5-merous whorls may be supposed, but the
development shows no indication of this, and it is not supported
in any other way. Several genera have “<i>gynobasic</i>” styles,
that is, the style springs from the base of the ovary (Fig. <a href="#fig497">497</a>
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p>The Rosifloræ are on one side closely related to the
Saxifragaceæ (especially through <i>Spiræa</i>) from which it
is difficult to separate them, and to the Myrtifloræ; on the
other side they are allied, through the Mimosaceæ with the large
number of stamens, and through the Amygdalaceæ with its single
carpel, to the Leguminosæ. The family begins with forms which
have many-seeded follicles, and passes on the one side to forms
with nuts and drupes in perigynous flowers, and on the other
side to the Pomaceæ.</p>

carpels and the fruit is 5 <i>follicles</i>, which are not enclosed
by the receptacle. The majority are shrubs. Stipules are often
wanting.&mdash;<i>Spiræa</i> (Meadow-Sweet). The flowers are generally borne
in richly flowered inflorescences of various forms. The carpels, in
some species, unite together and form a <i>simple</i> gynœceum with
free styles (an approach to the <i>Pomaceæ</i>).&mdash;<span class="smaller">Closely allied

an “<i>epicalyx</i>” (Fig. <a href="#fig494">494</a> <i>C</i>) alternating with the sepals
and formed by their stipules which are united in pairs, and hence
its leaves are often more or less deeply bifid. The receptacle is
cupular and often quite insignificant. The sepals are valvate in the

pendulous ovules, ripening into a <i>drupe</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig503">503</a>).&mdash;The leaves
are penninerved and frequently have <i>glands</i> on the stalks and
edges; <i>thorns</i> (modified branches) often occur, <i>i.e.</i>
dwarf-branches, which, after producing a few leaves, terminate their
growth in a thorn (<i>e.g. Prunus spinosa</i>). <span class="smaller">The vernation
of the <i>foliage-leaves</i> varies in the different genera; in the
Almond, Peach, Cherry, and Bird-Cherry they are folded; in the Apricot,
Plum, Sloe and Bullace, rolled together. In some the flowers unfold
before the leaves (<i>Amygdalus</i>, <i>Armeniaca</i>). That the
gynœceum is formed of 1 carpel is evident in this as in other instances
(<i>e.g.</i> in the Leguminosæ, which are closely related to this
order), from the fact that the carpel is oblique, and has only one
plane of symmetry, and similarly in the fruit there is a longitudinal
groove on one side which indicates the ventral suture. It is only
exceptionally that both ovules are developed. In abnormal instances
more than 1 carpel is developed.</span></p>

petals and generally 20 stamens (10 + 5 + 5, or 10 + 10 + 5). There are
from 1–5 <i>carpels</i>, which unite entirely or to some extent with
each other, and with the hollow, fleshy receptacle (the <i>flower</i>
becoming <i>epigynous</i>), (Figs. <a href="#fig505">505</a>, <a href="#fig506">506</a>, <a href="#fig507">507</a>). The carpels are
nearly always free on the ventral sutures, rarely free at the sides
also. The whole outer portion of the fruit becomes fleshy, but the
portions of the pericarp surrounding the loculi (endocarp) are most
frequently formed of sclerenchymatous cells, and are more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span>
firm (the “core”). The nature of the fruit varies, according to the
thickness and hardness of the endocarp, being either a “berry” or a
“drupe” (see <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). When the endocarp is thin and
parchment-like, the fruit has the characteristics of a berry, each
of the 5 loculi generally present containing several seeds; but when
this is hard the fruit resembles a drupe, only one seed is developed
in each loculus, and the number of the loculi is reduced to one or
two. There are nearly always 2 ovules in the loculi of the ovary, but
in <i>Cydonia</i> there are a large number in 2 rows. In the genera
which have stones, only one seed is developed in each stone. The genera
are distinguished mainly in accordance with the kind of fruit and the
number of ovules and seeds.</p>

<h4>Family 21. <b>Leguminosæ.</b></h4>

<p>The most characteristic feature is, that the <i>gynœceum is
1-locular</i> and formed of <i>1 carpel, the ventral suture of which is
turned posteriorly</i>. The fruit, in most instances, is a <i>pod</i>
(legume), which opens generally along both sutures, the two valves
twisting more or less in opposite directions. <span class="smaller">In other instances it
opens along one suture only, or as a pyxidium (Red Clover), or it is
indehiscent, in which case it is more or less berry-like (<i>e.g.</i>
the Tamarind, Carob-bean), or it is a drupe (<i>e.g.</i> the
Tonquin-bean), or a 1–few-seeded nut (<i>e.g. Melilotus</i>), or
a lomentum, which divides transversely into as many joints as there are
seeds (<i>Ornithopus</i>, see Fig. <a href="#fig513">513</a>).</span></p>

<p>The inflorescences belong to the <i>centripetal</i> type (<i>i.e.</i>
indefinite); cymes do not occur. The flowers are <i>zygomorphic</i>,
with vertical plane of symmetry, seldom regular; <i>5-merous</i>
with but a few exceptions, ☿, and slightly <i>perigynous</i>. The
following diagram is the most general (Fig. <a href="#fig511">511</a>): 5 sepals, with the
<i>unpaired sepal median and anterior</i>, 5 petals, 5 + 5 stamens,
all in alternating whorls, 1 carpel. The calyx is most frequently
gamosepalous, the gynœceum is narrowed down at the base to a short
stalk and, in the majority, is more or less bent. The seed is most
frequently kidney-shaped, with a smooth, hard and shining testa,
the hilum being very distinct. <i>Endosperm is wanting</i>, or is
reduced to a thin layer, which is of service when the seed swells
during germination. The vegetative parts have these features in
common, namely, the <i>leaves are scattered, stipulate</i>, and
almost always <i>compound</i>. Peculiar <i>sleep-movements</i> and
<i>sensitiveness</i> are found in some, chiefly in the Mimosas.
Many, probably all, Leguminosæ have <i>small tubercles on their
roots</i> which are produced by a kind of bacterium, and assist in the
assimilation of free nitrogen. Spontaneous movements are exhibited by
<i>Desmodium gyrans</i> (Telegraph-plant).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This family is closely allied to the Rosifloræ, with which
it agrees in the scattered leaves, the presence of stipules,
the generally 5-merous and most frequently perigynous
flowers with eucyclic stamens, and the absence of endosperm.
<i>Amygdalaceæ</i> and <i>Chrysobalanaceæ</i>, with solitary
carpels, approach on one side to the Leguminosæ, among which
genera with drupes are also found; <i>Mimosaceæ</i>, with their
many stamens, form a connecting link on the other side. In this
respect the Mimosa-genus <i>Affonsea</i>, and certain Cæsalpineæ
and Swartzieæ, are of special interest in having more than
one carpel (syncarp), a condition which is sometimes met with
abnormally in other Leguminosæ, as well as in Amygdalaceæ. About
7,000 species of the Leguminosæ are known.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Cæsalpiniaceæ.</b> These are <i>leguminous plants with
straight embryo and a flower which is not papilionaceous and has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>
the same æstivation</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig508">508–510</a>); but in reality there is not
a single characteristic which absolutely distinguishes them from the
Papilionaceæ.&mdash;The majority are arborescent; the leaves as a rule
are pinnate or bipinnate. The flower is 5-merous, most frequently
perigynous and slightly zygomorphic; the calyx is free or gamosepalous,
the corolla polypetalous with <i>ascending imbricate æstivation</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> the two lowest petals envelop the lateral ones, and these
again the posterior; Fig. <a href="#fig508">508</a>); 10 <i>free stamens</i>; fruit various.</p>

ternate.&mdash;<i>Melilotus</i> (Melilot) has a small, spherical or
lanceolate, thick and wrinkled fruit, which as a rule is indehiscent.
The inflorescence is a raceme, often long, or a spike, sometimes a
capitulum. Leaves ternate.&mdash;<i>Ononis</i> (Rest-harrow) differs in
having monadelphous stamens and in being more shrub-like and bushy, and
in having a normal, 2-valved pod, by which characteristic it approaches
the Genisteæ. The flowers are generally rose-coloured, solitary, or in
few-flowered racemes in the leaf-axils. Thorns (branches) are often
present; the leaves are compound with only one small leaflet (the
terminal one), or ternate with adnate stipules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> Especially effected by Bees. The nectar
is secreted by a ring or disc-like portion round the base
of the gynœceum or the inner surface of the receptacle. The
flower is constructed with a peculiar mechanism to ensure
cross-pollination by insects. The pollen is shed just before
the flower opens, and is retained in a pouch formed by the
keel. An insect visiting the flower uses the wings and keel
for a landing-stage, and in attempting to reach the honey
presses down the wings and the keel which are locked together
near the standard; the stylar-brush by this means is forced
through the apical opening of the keel and a little pollen is
thus swept out and deposited upon the abdomen of the visiting
insect as it presses against the apex of the keel;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span> the insect
thus carries away pollen and may effect cross-pollination. In

<p>Order 3. <b>Mimosaceæ.</b> The flowers are most frequently hypogynous
and <i>regular</i>, the æstivation of the corolla is <i>valvate</i>
and, in the majority of instances, that of the calyx also. The flower
is 4-merous, less frequently 5- or 3-merous.&mdash;The flowers are generally
small, but are always borne in compact, round <i>capitula</i> or spikes
(Fig. <a href="#fig514">514</a>); they are hypogynous or perigynous. The calyx is generally
<i>gamosepalous</i> and the corolla <i>gamopetalous</i>, the latter
being frequently wanting. The stamens are equal or double the number
of the petals (<i>Mimosa</i>, etc., in <i>M. pudica</i>, <i>e.g.</i>
S4, P4, A4, G1) or (in <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Inga</i>, etc.) in a large,
indefinite number, free or monadelphous, often united to the corolla
(Fig. <a href="#fig514">514</a> <i>b</i>). The colour of the flower in most cases is due to
the long and numerous stamens. The <i>fruit</i> is various. The embryo
is <i>straight</i> as in the Cæsalpiniaceæ. <i>Entada</i> and many
species of <i>Mimosa</i> have a flat, straight, or somewhat sickle-like
pod, which resembles the siliqua of the Cruciferæ in that the sutures
(in this instance, however, dorsal and ventral suture) persist as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span>
frame, but the intermediate portion divides, as in the transversely
divided siliqua, into as many nut-like portions as there are seeds.
Some species have a pod of enormous dimensions. The seeds of <i>Entada
gigalobium</i> are often carried from the West Indies to the N. W.
coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream.&mdash;The fruit of <i>Acacia</i>
in some species is an ordinary pod, in others it is transversely
divided, or remains an undivided fruit, a nut.&mdash;This order includes
both trees and herbaceous plants, which are often thorny; the leaves
are usually bipinnate (Fig. <a href="#fig514">514</a>) and are sensitive, and also possess
sleep-movements.&mdash;Many Australian Acacias have compound leaves only
when young, but when old have <i>phyllodia</i>, <i>i.e.</i> leaf-like
petioles without blades, placed vertically. A large number have thorny
stipules, which in some (<i>Acacia sphærocephala</i>) attain an
enormous size, and serve as a home for ants, which in return protect
their host-plant against the attacks of other, leaf-cutting ants.</p>

<h4>Family 22. <b>Passiflorinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers are most frequently regular, 5-merous in the three
most external whorls, eucyclic and perigynous or epigynous, less
frequently hypogynous. A characteristic feature is that the
ovary is <i>tricarpellary</i>, <i>unilocular</i>, and with 3
<i>parietal</i> placentæ which sometimes meet in the central line
(<i>Cucurbitaceæ</i>). The styles are generally free and <i>bifid</i>.
To all these characteristics, however, there are exceptions. <span class="smaller">The
Cucurbitaceæ are sometimes placed among the Sympetalæ, close to the
Campanulinæ, but they are not allied to the Sympetalæ, from which they
differ especially, for instance, in the structure of the ovule. The
position of the Begoniaceæ in this family is also open to doubt.</span></p>

5 free stamens. Sometimes the rudiment of a gynœceum is present. The
carpels are united into an <i>ovary</i> with 3 (4–5) placentæ formed by
their united edges. These are thick, fleshy, and <i>bifid</i>, bearing
a number of ovules on each side (Figs. <a href="#fig517">517</a> <i>B</i>; <a href="#fig518">518</a> <i>C</i>,
<i>D</i>); in general the placentæ are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span> so large that they not only
meet in the centre, but also fill up the ovary as far as the wall of
the pericarp. The whole interior of the fruit thus becomes a juicy mass
in which three lines may be seen, meeting in the centre (the boundaries
of the individual placentæ), and near the circumference 6 groups of
seeds (Fig. <a href="#fig518">518</a> <i>D</i>). When the carpels are equal in number to
the petals they alternate with them. The <i>style</i> is short and
thick, and generally divided into 3 (4–5) branches, with a horse-shoe
shaped stigma on each branch (Fig. <a href="#fig518">518</a> <i>C</i>). The <i>fruit</i>
is most frequently a many-seeded <i>berry</i>; in some it attains a
considerable size and has a firm external layer (<i>Cucurbita</i>,
<i>Lagenaria</i>, etc.). <i>The embryo is straight</i>, has <i>no
endosperm</i>, but contains a large quantity of <i>oil</i>. The
exceptions to the above characters will be found under the genera.</p>

<p>Exclusively herbs, generally with stiff hairs and yellow flowers. Many
species are annuals, others are perennial, having tuberous roots or
hypocotyls. The leaves are scattered, long-stalked, in most cases more
or less heart-shaped, palminerved, palmilobed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span> and exstipulate; in
their axils are found both flowers (singly, or in an inflorescence)
and a vegetative bud, and outside the axil, <i>on the anodic<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> side
of the leaf, a simple or branched tendril</i>, by which the plant
<i>climbs</i> (exceptions: <i>e.g. Ecballium</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The position of the flowers, branches and tendrils situated
in and near the leaf-axils is as follows. In the leaf-axils,
a flower is borne (as a branch of the first order), ♂ or ♀,
according to the conditions of the various genera. This branch
is not situated in the centre of the axil, but is removed
slightly towards the anodic side of the leaf. Of its two
bracteoles as a rule only the one lying on the anodic side is
developed, namely as a tendril, which is displaced to a position
outside the axil. The branch of the first order bears on its
catodic side an inflorescence (in the axil of the suppressed
bracteole), on the anodic side a vegetative bud which grows out
into a branch like the main axis. The subtending leaf of this
branch is thus the tendril; but when it has several arms the
condition is complicated by the appearance of an accessory bud
which unites with its subtending leaf, the tendril, its leaves
also becoming tendrils (situated on an undeveloped internode);
the many-branched tendril is thus a branch, and the tendril-arms
are its leaves, except the main arm which is its subtending
leaf. Other explanations of these difficult relations have been
given.&mdash;The <i>germination</i> is somewhat peculiar, owing to
the fact that a heel-like prolongation is formed at the base
of the hypocotyl to assist in separating the two halves of the
testa from each other, and to facilitate the unfolding of the
cotyledons.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cucurbita</i> (Pumpkin, Marrow) has branched tendrils; the flowers
are monœcious, and are borne singly; the corolla is bell-shaped, and
divided almost as far as the middle. The stamens are all united into a
tube; the compressed seeds have a thick, blunt edge.&mdash;<i>Cucumis</i>
has (generally) unbranched tendrils; the ♀-flowers are borne singly,
whilst the ♂-flowers are borne in groups: the corolla is divided
nearly as far as the base, and the stamens are united 2-2-1.
The connective is elongated above the anthers. The seeds have a
sharp edge.&mdash;<i>Citrullus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig518">518</a>) has a corolla similar to
<i>Cucumis</i>, but ☿-and ♂-flowers are borne singly; the stigma is
only 3-lobed, the fruit most frequently spherical.&mdash;<i>Ecballium</i>
(Squirting Cucumber, only 1 species, E. <i>elaterium</i>) has no
tendrils, and is therefore not a climber. The oblong fruit is pendulous
from the apex of its stalk, and when ripe is distended with an acrid,
watery fluid; on being touched the fruit is detached, and the seeds,
together with the watery fluid, are violently ejected through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span> the
aperture formed at the base of the fruit. The ♂-flowers are borne in
racemes near the solitary ♀-flowers (Fig. <a href="#fig517">517</a>).&mdash;<i>Bryonia</i> (White
Bryony) has chiefly unbranched tendrils and small, greenish-yellow,
usually diœcious flowers with rotate corolla, in many-flowered
inflorescences; the small, spherical berry has no specially firm outer
layer, and generally only few seeds. The tap-root and a few of the
other roots are tuberous. <i>B. alba</i> (berry black; monœcious) and
<i>dioica</i> (berry red; diœcious). <span class="smaller">Among other genera may be
mentioned: <i>Lagenaria</i> (Gourd); the fruit has a woody external
layer which, after the removal of the pulpy integument, may be used as
a gourd. <i>Luffa</i> has a polypetalous corolla; the fruit is dry,
and consists internally of a network of vascular bundles; it opens by
an aperture at the summit. <i>Benincasa</i>; the fruit has a close,
bluish coating of wax. <i>Trichosanthes</i> (Snake Cucumber) has a
thin, round, long and curved fruit. <i>Momordica</i>; the fleshy fruit
opens and ejects the seeds. <i>Cyclanthera</i> takes its name from the
staminal column which is found in the centre of the ♂-flower, bearing
a bilocular, ring-like anther which opens by a horizontal cleft. The
fruit is unilocular by suppression, has 1 placenta, and when touched
opens and ejects the seeds. <i>Sicyos</i> and <i>Sechium</i> have
only unilocular ovaries with one pendulous ovule. <i>Sechium</i>
has, moreover, 5 free stamens, of which only one is halved, the
other 4 having both halves of the anther. <i>Fevillea</i> and
<i>Thladiantha</i> also have 5 free stamens. <i>Dimorphochlamys</i> has
dimorphic flowers.</span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination</span> is effected by insects, chiefly bees
or wasps, the nectar being secreted by the inner, yellow
portion of the receptacle; in the ♂-flower access is gained
to the nectar through the slits between the stamens, which
arch over the nectary.&mdash;85 genera; about 637 species;
especially in the Tropics. Only two are found in the whole
of N. Europe, <i>Bryonia alba</i> and <i>dioica</i>; in S.
Europe, <i>Ecballium</i> also. Most of the cultivated species
have been obtained from Asia, such as the Cucumber, Melon,
Colocynth, several <i>Luffa</i>-species (the “Gourds” mentioned
in Scripture are <i>Cucumis chate</i>); from Africa, the
Water-melon, <i>Cucurbita maxima</i>, and others; from S. Am.,
no doubt, the Pumpkin (<i>C. pepo</i> and <i>melopepo</i>).
<span class="smcap">Uses.</span> Many species are used in medicine or for
domestic purposes. <i>Bitter</i>, <i>poisonous properties</i>
are found; the fruits of the two <i>officinal</i> ones are
purgative: <i>Citrullus colocynthis</i> (Mediterranean, E.
India, Ceylon) and <i>Ecballium elaterium</i>, as well as
various tropical species, the roots of Bryonia, etc.&mdash;The
following are cultivated <span class="allsmcap">AS ARTICLES OF FOOD</span>:
Pumpkin (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>, etc.), Cucumber (<i>Cucumis
sativus</i>), Melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>), the Water-melon
(<i>Citrullus vulgaris</i>), <i>Sechium edule</i> (Chocho),
certain species of <i>Luffa</i> (the young fruit). The Bottle
Gourd is cultivated in tropical countries for the sake of its
hard pericarp, which is useful for bowls, bottles, etc. The
fruits of <i>Luffa</i> have a number of reticulately felted,
tolerably firm vascular bundles, which render them serviceable
in various ways (as a kind of “sponge”). The Cucurbits are of no
use in the manufactures. Only a few are cultivated as ornamental
plants, chiefly as curiosities.</p>

<h4>Family 23. <b>Myrtifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The leaves are most frequently <i>opposite</i>, <i>simple</i>,
<i>entire</i> (rarely dentate), and <i>exstipulate</i>. The flowers are
<i>regular</i> and <i>epigynous</i> (perigynous in <i>Lythraceæ</i>
and a few others), ☿, polypetalous; the number of members in a
whorl is generally 4 or 5 (S, P, A, or most frequently A 2, G), but
sometimes it becomes (<i>e.g.</i> Myrtles and <i>Lythraceæ</i>) very
large in the andrœcium by splitting, and in the gynœceum also is
often different. (When suppression takes place it is principally in
the corolla and petal-stamens.) In nearly all instances the calyx
is <i>valvate</i>. Gyncœceum multicarpellary, multilocular, with
only one <i>style</i> (except <i>Haloragidaceæ</i>). In the majority
the ovules are situated on an axile placenta in the multilocular
ovary. <i>Endosperm is wanting</i> in the majority.&mdash;<span class="smaller">Less
important exceptions: <i>Rhizophoraceæ</i> and <i>Gunnera</i> have
stipules. <i>Haloragidaceæ</i> have several styles and endosperm.
<i>Rhizophora</i> also has endosperm.</span></p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Lythraceæ.</b> <i>Hermaphrodite</i>, <i>perigynous</i>
flowers which are <i>most frequently <b>6</b>-merous</i>, viz. S 6
(often with a <i>commissural</i> “<i>epicalyx</i>,” Fig. <a href="#fig519">519</a> <i>c</i>),
one segment posterior, P 6, A 6 + 6 or 6 + 0 and G <b>2–6</b>, forming
a 2–6-locular ovary with many ovules in the loculi, style single,
and capitate stigma. The <i>gynœceum is free</i> at the base of the
tubular, or bell-shaped, <i>thin</i>, strongly veined receptacle,
which bears the other leaf-whorls on its edge and inner side. Fruit
a capsule. No endosperm.&mdash;To this order belong both herbs, shrubs
and trees. The branches are frequently square, the leaves always
<i>undivided</i>, <i>entire</i>, and without stipules, or with several
very small stipules, and often opposite. The calyx is valvate. The
flower is regular (except <i>Cuphea</i>) and frequently large and
beautiful. The stamens are generally incurved in the bud, and the
petals irregularly folded.</p>

the “epicalyx.”</p>
  </div>

<p><i>Lythrum</i> (Loose-strife). The flower is diplostemonous and
6-merous, with a long, tubular receptacle with epicalyx-teeth (Fig.
<a href="#fig519">519</a> <i>c</i>). The 12 stamens are arranged in two tiers on the
inner side of the receptacle. The gynœceum is bicarpellary. <span class="smaller">The
flowers are borne in small dichasia in the leaf-axils, and their
number is increased by accessory inflorescences beneath the main
inflorescence.&mdash;The native species, <i>L. salicaria</i>, is trimorphic
(long-styled, mid-and short-styled forms, Fig. <a href="#fig520">520</a>). Cross-pollination
is chiefly effected by humble-bees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span> and bees, which seek the nectar
formed at the bottom of the receptacle. Other species are only
dimorphic, or even monomorphic.</span>&mdash;Closely allied are, <i>Nesæa</i>,
<i>Diplusodon</i>, <i>Lagerstrœmia</i>, and <i>Cuphea</i>, whose flower
resembles that of <i>Lythrum</i>, but is zygomorphic. In <i>Cuphea</i>
the receptacle is oblique and at the back prolonged into a <i>spur</i>,
in which the nectar, secreted by a gland situated behind the ovary,
is collected; the calyx and corolla gradually become reduced in size
toward the anterior side of the flower; the reverse, however, is the
case with the 11 stamens (the posterior one is absent); the posterior
loculus in the bilocular ovary is sometimes barren; the fruit, when
ripe, dehisces along the posterior side, the ovary as well as the wall
of the receptacle being ruptured by the placenta, which expands and
projects freely. <span class="smaller">The flowers stand singly in the centre of the stem,
between the pairs of leaves. This may be explained as follows: of the
two foliage-leaves in each pair, one supports a foliage-shoot, the
other a flower; the foliage-shoot remains in the axil, but the flower
is displaced through the length of an entire internode to the next pair
of leaves, and then assumes a position between these two leaves. All
foliage-shoots stand in two rows, the flowers in two other rows.</span></p>

<p>365 species; 30 genera; mostly in the Tropics, and more
especially S. Am.&mdash;Some yield <i>dyes</i>, <i>e.g.</i>

placed as an independent order.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Melastomaceæ.</b> A very natural and very large
order (150 genera; 2,500 species), its home being chiefly in
tropical S. America, especially the Brazils (termed by Schouw
“The kingdom of Palms and Melastomaceæ”). There are both
herbaceous and arborescent species, which are easily recognized
by the opposite or verticillate, simple leaves which have (with
the exception of a few heather-like species) 3–5–7–9 curved
veins proceeding from the base of the leaf, and connected very
regularly by closely parallel, transverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span> veins. The flower
is perigynous or epigynous; its type is that of the Onagraceæ
(4–5-merous; 1 whorl of sepals, petals and carpels, 2 of
stamens); the calyx is valvate, the corolla is twisted (to
the left) in æstivation; the stamens are very characteristic;
in the bud they are geniculate; the anther opens in the often
long, beak-like, prolonged point, with 1, less frequently with
2 pores, and has generally ear-like appendages at its base.
The fruit is a berry or capsule. These large and beautiful
flowering-plants play a very important part in South American
landscapes; otherwise they are of slight importance (a few are
cultivated in conservatories, <i>e.g. Centradenia</i>,
<i>Medinilla</i>, <i>Lasiandra</i>, <i>Tibouchina</i>,

carpels, 2 of stamens); 2–3–5–6-merous flowers are less frequent;
<i>the calyx is valvate</i>, the <i>corolla twisted</i> in æstivation
(the left edge being covered). Gynœceum simple with multilocular
ovary; the <i>style is undivided</i>, filiform, and bears a capitate
or 4-partite stigma; endosperm wanting; embryo straight.&mdash;The majority
are herbs, especially water- and marsh-plants; several are shrubs. No
essential oils. The leaves are alternate or opposite, always single,
and without (or with very small) stipules. <span class="smaller">The odourless flowers
sometimes have a coloured calyx. In some instances (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Œnothera</i>, <i>Fuchsia</i>) the receptacle is prolonged more or
less beyond the inferior ovary, and finally falls off. The stamens are
obdiplostemonous (carpels epipetalous); the petal-stamens are sometimes
suppressed. The anthers in some genera are divided into storeys. The
well-pronounced, triangular pollen-grains are connected together by
viscous threads. Small stipules are sometimes found, <i>e.g.</i>

<i>Jussiæa</i> (dehiscence septicidal), <i>Isnardia</i> (petal-stamens
absent, sometimes the petals also).&mdash;<i>Lopezia</i> has a peculiar,
zygomorphic flower (Fig. <a href="#fig521">521</a>); one of the four sepals is bent forwards

the 2 anterior ones which are turned obliquely backwards and bent
like a knee, with a greenish nectary at the bend; 2 stamens, one only
fertile (the posterior), while the anterior is barren, petaloid, and
spoon-shaped; both are sensitive, which is essential for pollination.

The flowers are borne in racemes without bracts.&mdash;<i>Gaura.</i></p>

<p><b>D.</b> <b>Fruit a drupe.</b> <i>Trapa</i> (Horn-nut); a peculiar
aquatic plant; the submerged stem has long internodes and lanceolate
leaves, falling off at an early period, but at each node are found 4
long roots with thin, lateral roots (sometimes erroneously regarded as
leaves) borne pinnately; the stem reaching the surface of the water,
bears a rosette of rhombic foliage-leaves, with large, inflated stalks
containing air, and forming the floating apparatus of the plants.
In the axils of the leaves (as in <i>Gunnera</i>) 8 small, stipular
structures are present. The flowers are solitary in the axils of the
foliage-leaves (S4, P4, A4 + 0, G2), <i>semi</i>-epigynous. There is
an 8-lobed, crenate disc on the free portion of the ovary; one ovule
in each loculus. The fruit is a <i>drupe</i> with 4 (or 2) prominent
horns (the persistent sepals), which after the pulp has decayed away
bear a series of hooks turned downwards on each side, <i>i.e.</i>
sclerenchymatous bundles which formerly lay concealed in the pulp of
the sepals. <span class="smaller">The germination is peculiar: one of the cotyledons is
large, and its thick extremity remains in the fruit, the other however
is small and is pushed out at the apex of the fruit together with the
radicle and plumule; the development of the root soon ceases, and the
plumule usually grows into a stem entirely without branches, similar
to the one described above, only that 1–2 precisely similar shoots
arise in the axil of each cotyledon, so that each embryo produces 3–5
shoots.&mdash;<i>Trapa</i>, by its mode of life, its 1-seeded fruit, etc.,
forms a transition to <i>Haloragidaceæ</i>.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The large-flowered forms are adapted for insect-pollination and

in crowded inflorescences. The flower, when most complete, has S2, P2,
A2 (petal-stamens) and G2, forming an inferior, unilocular ovary with
1 ovule. It is remarkable for the great number of stipules placed in
transverse rows in the leaf-axils, for the peculiar glandular organs,
and for the colonies of <i>Nostoc</i>, which are found embedded in the
cortex as a kind of parasite.</span>&mdash;The simplest form is <i>Hippuris</i>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 6. <b>Rhizophoraceæ.</b> Tropical trees or shrubs (50
species, the best known being <i>Rhizophora mangle</i>,
Mangrove) which grow gregariously, especially along the banks of
rivers and by sea-coasts, where the water is quiet and brackish,
and where they form the so-called Mangrove-swamps. Aerial roots
are formed on the stems and branches (Fig. <a href="#fig522">522</a> <i>A</i>). The
seeds germinate in the fruit, which by arrest contains only one
seed (Fig. <a href="#fig522">522</a> <i>B</i>), before it is detached from the tree.
The radicle projects considerably from the seed, and hangs down
freely in the air; when the embryo is finally detached from
the mother-plant, the separation is effected by the hood-like
cotyledon, which entirely envelops the plumule, becoming
detached from the rest of the embryo, which falls down, while
the hood-like cotyledon remains enclosed in the fruit. The
embryo, after it has fallen, strikes root, and continues growing
in the undisturbed mud under the trees, or perhaps it may first
be drifted about by the water, being well adapted for this by
its peculiar, tough nature, and large, intercellular spaces.&mdash;It
may also further be remarked that the anther is divided into a
number of small loculi. The leaves are stipulate. The endosperm
projects from the micropyle, growing out from the base of the
seed, and thus serves as an organ of suction to convey nutriment
to the embryo from the mother-plant.</p>

<p>Order 8. <b>Myrtaceæ (Myrtles).</b> The plants belonging to this order
are shrubs or trees, the majority being easily recognised by the
vegetative characters. The leaves, for instance, are most frequently
opposite, without stipules, undivided and entire, parchment-like or
leathery, evergreen, <i>aromatic</i>, finely dotted by <i>pellucid
glands containing essential oils</i>; the venation is penninerved
with a nerve just inside and running parallel to the edge of the
leaf. The flowers are regular, epigynous (Figs. <a href="#fig523_524">523</a>, <a href="#fig523_524">524</a>, <a href="#fig525">525</a>) and ☿,
most frequently <b>4-</b> or 5-merous in the calyx and corolla, with
<i>many</i> stamens (by splitting, so that they are often in several
distinct bundles) and an ovary with one style, formed of 2–5–many
carpels; the receptacle is most frequently united for its entire
length with the ovary. The fruit varies, but is <i>most frequently a
berry</i>. The embryo is thick, often curved, with united cotyledons;
no endosperm.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Myrteæ, Myrtle Group.</span> Chiefly American, though some
are found also in Africa and Asia. The fruit is a <i>berry</i>
with generally 2–5 loculi in the ovary, and many ovules in
each.&mdash;<i>Myrtus</i>; <i>Eugenia</i> (the petals fall off together
as a hood in the Clove, <i>E. caryophyllata</i>, Figs. <a href="#fig523_524">523</a>, <a href="#fig523_524">524</a>);
<i>Myrcia</i>; <i>Jambosa</i>; <i>Amomis</i>; <i>Psidium</i>, etc.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Puniceæ, Pomegranate Group.</span> Only 2 species (<i>Punica
granatum</i>; from Persia, Afghanistan), differing in several respects
from the typical form of the Myrtaceæ. The leaves are generally
<i>opposite</i>, without glands and marginal veins. The receptacle,
calyx and corolla are red; the latter 5–8–(generally 6-) merous. Calyx
valvate and corolla folded as in Lythraceæ, stamens also and epicalyx
as in this order. The most characteristic feature is the inferior,
spherical berry, with dry pericarp, formed from two whorls of carpels
in two tiers (Fig. <a href="#fig525">525</a>); the interior whorl, which is also the lower,
has 3 carpels, and the placentæ are situated in the inner angles of
the 3 loculi; the external whorl is 5-merous, and the placentæ have
originally the same position in the inner angles of the loculi, but
their position is changed to the outer side of the loculi owing to the
growth of the wall of the ovary, which takes place early, causing the
carpels to become, as it were, turned inside out, so that the part
which was turned downwards is turned upwards, and the part which was
turned inwards becomes turned outwards (as in <i>Mesembrianthemum</i>).
The edible part of the fruit is the <i>fleshy testa</i>, as in
<i>Ribes</i>. The cotyledons are rolled together spirally.</p>

<h4>Family 24. <b>Umbellifloræ.</b></h4>

<p>The flower is regular, ☿, and <i>completely epigynous</i>, 5- or
4-merous, with <b>1</b> whorl of stamens and 5–2 carpels. <i>Sepals
very small, tooth-like.</i> The <i>corolla is polypetalous, most
frequently valvate in æstivation</i> (least pronounced in the
Umbelliferous plants). Round the base of the styles, which are
generally free, there is an <i>epigynous</i> (undivided, or divided)
<i>nectar-disc</i> (“stylar-foot”: Figs. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>,
<i>D</i>; <a href="#fig539">539</a>); the number of loculi in the ovary equals that of
the carpels; <i>only <b>1</b> pendulous (anatropous) ovule</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>C</i>) <i>in each loculus</i>. Endosperm copious (Fig.
<a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>D</i>). To this must be added that the inflorescence in the
majority of cases is an <i>umbel</i> or a capitulum, especially in the
<i>Umbelliferæ</i> and <i>Araliaceæ</i>. Stipules are absent, but most
frequently the base of the petiole forms a large sheath.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Umbellifloræ are on one side so closely allied to the
Frangulinæ, especially Rhamnaceæ, that they may perhaps be
regarded as the epigynous continuation of this family. On
the other hand, the similarities to the Rubiales, especially
those between Cornaceæ and Sambuceæ, are so great that there
is scarcely any character to distinguish them except the
polypetalous corolla of the former and the gamopetalous corolla
of the latter. Whether this is more than a merely analogous
resemblance, and if not, whether the Cornaceæ at least should
not be included in the Rubiales, must be left in abeyance.&mdash;The
sepals are very small, as is generally the case in epigynous
flowers.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Cornaceæ.</b> The majority of the species are shrubs
with solid internodes, <i>opposite</i> (rarely scattered)
leaves, which are <i>simple</i>, <i>entire</i> (rarely incised),
penninerved, <i>without</i> stipules or large sheaths; flowers
<i><b>4</b>-merous</i> (most frequently S4, P4, A4, G2), borne
in dichasia which are either collected into corymbs (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Cornus sanguinea</i>), or in closely crowded umbels or capitula
(<i>Cornus mas</i>, <i>C. suecica</i>), in which latter case there is
often a <i>large</i>, leafy, or coloured, most frequently 4-leaved
<i>involucre</i> round the base of the inflorescence; the <i>style is
undivided</i>, with lobed stigma; the raphe of the ovule is turned
<i>outwards</i>. The fruit is a <i>berry</i> or a <i>drupe</i>, with a
1–4-locular stone or 2 free stones.</p>

<p><i>Cornus</i> (Dogwood, Cornel) has S4, P4, A4, G2. Leaves opposite.</p>

<i>Cornus</i> and <i>Aucuba japonica</i> (Japan) are cultivated
as ornamental shrubs.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Araliaceæ (Ivies).</b> Principally <i>trees</i> or
<i>shrubs</i> with <i>solid stems</i>. The leaves are <i>scattered</i>,
simple or compound, with a sheath more or less developed. The flowers
are most frequently situated in umbels or capitula which are either
borne singly or in racemes, or in paniculate inflorescences. The small,
most frequently yellowish-green flowers are <b>5</b>-<i>merous</i>, in
the calyx, corolla, and andrœcium; the gynœceum may be 5-merous or may
have some other number (<b>2</b>-∞). The styles are most frequently
several, free; the <i>raphe</i> of the ovules is turned <i>inwards</i>
as in the Umbelliferous plants. The fruit is a <i>drupe</i> or
<i>berry</i>.&mdash;<span class="smaller">Stellate hairs often occur. The petals generally
have a broad base, and a thick apex which is slightly incurved, and a
distinctly valvate æstivation.</span></p>

<p><i>Hedera helix</i> (Ivy) climbs by adventitious roots. The leaves are
palminerved and lobed on the sterile branches, but often ovate and not
lobed on the flowering branches. <span class="smaller">The flowers are yellowish-green
and open in the autumn; they are slightly protandrous, and are visited
by flies and wasps. Berries black. Endosperm ruminate.&mdash;<i>Panax.</i>
<i>Aralia</i> (with <i>Dimorphanthus</i>).</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>375 species, 51 genera; especially in the Tropics (E.
Asia).&mdash;The Ivy, several species of <i>Aralia</i>, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>A. japonica</i> (<i>Fatsia</i>), <i>Gastonia palmata</i>, are
cultivated as ornamental plants. Paper is manufactured from the
pith of <i>Aralia papyrifera</i> (China).</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Umbelliferæ.</b> <i>The stem is herbaceous</i> with
<i>hollow internodes</i>; the leaves are <i>scattered</i>, and have
a broad, amplexicaul base, a <i>large, most frequently inflated
sheath</i>, and generally a pinnate (often very much dissected)
blade. <span class="smaller">Entire leaves are found in <i>Hydrocotyle vulgaris</i>;
<i>Bupleurum</i>.</span></p>

<p>The flowers are ☿, regular, small, but collected in <i>compound
umbels</i>, that is, in “simple umbels,” which again are borne in
umbels (for exceptions see <i>Hydrocotyleæ</i>); the external flowers
in the simple umbel have often subtending bracts, which surround
the base as an <i>involucre</i>, and may be termed the <i>small
involucre</i>; the internal ones have no bracts; when involucral leaves
are present at the base of the compound umbel, they may be termed the
<i>large involucre</i>.</p>

The petals have a short claw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span> are most frequently obcordate, or have
an incurved apex (Fig. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>), being incurved in the
bud; they are white, rarely yellow (Fennel and Parsnips), blue or
red. The flowers are sometimes zygomorphic, especially those on the
circumference of the umbel, and in that case it is the petal which
is directed outside (anterior) which is the largest, and the two
posterior are the smallest (<i>e.g. Heracleum</i>). The stamens are
<i>incurved</i> in the bud. The 2 <i>free styles</i> unite at the base
into the “stylar-foot” (<i>stylopod</i>), a swollen nectary (Fig. <a href="#fig528">528</a>
<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>); the ovary is bilocular, the raphe of the ovules
being directed inwards. <i>The fruit is a schizocarp</i>, <i>dividing
into two mericarps</i>; the plane in which these separate coincides
with that of the union of the carpels, and the two <i>nut-like
mericarps</i> are in most genera kept together for awhile at the top
of a thin, bifid, or undivided stalk (<i>carpophore</i>) which is in
direct continuation with the flower-stalk (Fig. <a href="#fig537">537</a>). Each mericarp
has most frequently 5 more or less strongly projecting ridges, the
<i>primary ridges</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig530">530</a>, <a href="#fig532">532</a>, <a href="#fig534">534</a>, <a href="#fig535">535</a>, etc.), of which 3
lie on the back of the mericarp, the <i>dorsal ridges</i>, and 2 on
its edge near the plane of division, the <i>marginal ridges</i>; five
of these (10 ridges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span> in all in the entire fruit) are placed opposite
the calyx-teeth and the others between them. In some genera there are
in addition 4 <i>secondary ridges</i> to each mericarp between the
primary ones (Fig. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>E</i>: the secondary ridges bear the long
bristles). Inside these secondary ridges, or inside the grooves between
the primary ridges, when the secondary ridges are absent, <i>oil
ducts</i> (vittæ, schizogenous ducts) are found in the pericarp, most
frequently one in each groove; two are also often found on the ventral
side of each mericarp (Figs. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>E</i>, 530 <i>ol</i>, etc.). The
seed is most frequently united with the pericarp. The <i>embryo</i>
is <i>small</i> and lies high up in the large, most frequently horny
endosperm (Fig. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>D</i>).&mdash;The endosperm <i>does not contain
starch, but oil</i>, and presents three different forms, of important
systematic value: (<b>a</b>) those which are quite flat on the ventral
side (<i>i.e.</i> the side turned towards the plane of splitting)
(Figs. <a href="#fig528">528</a> <i>E</i>, <a href="#fig530">530</a>, <a href="#fig531">531</a>, <a href="#fig534">534</a>, etc.): the majority of the genera,
<span class="smcap">Orthospermeæ</span> (<i>e.g. Carum</i>, <i>Pastinaca</i>);
(<b>b</b>) those in which the endosperm on the ventral side is provided
with a longitudinal groove, often deep: <span class="smcap">Campylospermeæ</span>
(<i>e.g. Anthriscus</i>); the transverse section is nearly
a crescent (Fig. <a href="#fig532">532</a>); (<b>c</b>) those in which the endosperm is

sometimes to such an extent that the stamens have already fallen
off before the styles begin to develop (Fig <a href="#fig539">539</a>, 2). Insect
visits are more frequent and numerous as the inflorescences are
more conspicuous. The flowers as a rule are ☿, but ♂-flowers
are often found interspersed among the others (Fig. <a href="#fig539">539</a>), and
the number of these becomes greater on the umbels developed at
the latest period. A terminal flower, which differs from the
others in form, and in <i>Daucus carota</i> often in colour also

<p>Order 1. <i>Aristolochiaceæ.</i> The majority are perennial herbs or

cordate or reniform leaves are borne in 2 rows and are exstipulate.
The flowers are <i>hermaphrodite</i>, <i>epigynous</i>, regular or

<i>petaloid</i> and 3-merous; 6 or 12 (in <i>Thottea</i> as many as

completely 4–6-locular with ovules attached in the inner angles of
the loculi (Fig. <a href="#fig540">540</a> <i>kf</i>). The style is short, and has a large,
radiating stigma (Fig. <a href="#fig540">540</a> <i>n</i>). Fruit a capsule. Seeds rich in
endosperm.</p>

<p><i>Asarum europæum.</i> Each shoot has 2 reniform foliage-leaves,
between which the terminal flower is borne (the rhizome becomes
a sympodium by development of the bud in the axil of the upper
foliage-leaf). The flower is <i>regular</i> and has a bell-shaped
perianth with 3 outer valvate, and 3 inner small segments (which
may be wanting). <b>12</b> (2 × 6) free, extrorse stamens, 6
carpels.&mdash;<i>Aristolochia clematitis</i> (Birth-wort) has an erect,
unbranched stem, bearing many flowers in the leaf-axils, in a zig-zag
row (accessory buds in a unipared scorpioid cyme). The flowers are
zygomorphic (Fig. <a href="#fig540">540</a>), formed by 3 alternating, 6-merous whorls. The
perianth has a lower, much-distended part (<i>k</i>), succeeded by a

tongue-like projection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span> (6 vascular bundles indicate that the number

the short style to form a <i>stylar column</i>; they are placed quite
beneath the 6 commissural stigmatic rays, which arch over them as
short, thick lobes. <span class="smaller">Protogynous; <span class="smcap">Pollination</span> is effected

without being prevented by the stiff, downwardly-turned hairs which
line the tube and prevent their escape; they find the stigma (<i>n</i>)
fully developed, and may pollinate it with the pollen they have brought
with them. The stigmas then straighten and wither (<i>B</i>, <i>n</i>),
the anthers open, and the flies may again be covered with pollen; but
the hairs which blocked up the tube do not wither until the anthers
have shed their pollen, and only then allow the imprisoned flies to
escape and effect cross-pollination. Prior to pollination, the flowers
stand erect, but after this has taken place they become pendulous, and
the perianth soon withers.&mdash;<i>A. sipho</i> (Pipe-flower), another

<p>Order 2. <b>Santalaceæ.</b> Parasites containing chlorophyll,
which, by the help of peculiar organs of suction (haustoria)
on their roots, live principally on the roots of other
plants. Some are herbs, others under-shrubs. The regular,
most frequently ☿-flowers have a simple perianth, which is
gamophyllous, 3- or 5 partite with the segments valvate in
the bud, and a corresponding number of stamens opposite the
perianth-leaves. In the inferior ovary there is a <i>free,
centrally placed</i>, often long and curved <i>placenta</i>
with three ovules (one opposite each carpel); these are naked,
or in any case have an extremely insignificant integument.
Fruit a nut or drupe. Seed without testa. Endosperm fleshy. 225
species; chiefly in the Tropics.&mdash;<i>Thesium</i>, a native,
is a herb with scattered, linear leaves and small 5-merous

alternating with the lobes of the stigma, which serve as flying
organs and to attach the fruits to a branch (Fig. <a href="#fig541">541</a>), the
brushes twining round as soon as they come in contact with it.
There is only 1 seed in the fruit, which germinates by a long,
negatively heliotropic hypocotyl, and is attached by a radicle
modified into an haustorium.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Loranthaceæ</b> (<b>Mistletoes</b>). Plants containing
chlorophyll which are parasites on trees, and most frequently have
opposite, simple, entire leaves and regular, epigynous, often
unisexual, 2- or 3-merous flowers, with single or double perianth.
Stamens equal in number and opposite to the perianth-leaves, free,
or in varying degrees united to one another. The inferior ovary is
constructed as in the Santalaceæ, the ovules being situated on a low,
free, centrally-placed placenta, but the placenta and ovules unite with
the wall of the ovary into <i>one connected, parenchymatous mass</i>,
in which <i>the embryo-sacs are imbedded</i>. Only 1 (less frequently
2–3) of the 1–6 embryo-sacs is fertile. The number of the carpels
however varies. The fruit is a <i>1-seeded berry</i>, whose inner layer
is changed into a <i>tough slimy mass</i> (bird-lime), which serves to
attach the fruits to other plants.</p>

<p>The Mistletoe (<i>Viscum album</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig542">542</a>) is a native, evergreen
plant which may be found growing on almost any of our trees (sometimes
on the Oak), and, like other Loranthaceæ, it produces swellings of
the affected branches. <span class="smaller">Its spherical white berries (Fig. <a href="#fig542">542</a>
<i>A</i>) enclose (1–) 2–3 green embryos; they are eaten by birds
(especially Thrushes), and are partly sown with their excrement,
partly struck or brushed off the branches of the trees, the seed
being enclosed, at maturity, by viscin, <i>i.e.</i> “bird-lime.”
The seeds may also germinate on the branches, without having first
passed through the alimentary canal of the birds. On germination,
the hypocotyl-axis first appears, as in Fig. <a href="#fig541">541</a>, and bends towards
the branch; the apex of the root then broadens, and forms at the
end a disc-like haustorium, from the centre of which a root-like
body grows through the bark into the wood, and ramifies between the
bark and wood. Suckers are developed on the root like strands which
are formed in this manner, without, however, having a rootcap; they
are green, and penetrate the wood by the medullary rays (Fig. <a href="#fig542">542</a>
<i>C</i>). Adventitious buds may also be developed from the root-like
strands which break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span> through the bark and emerge as young plants.
The young stem quickly ceases its longitudinal growth, and lateral
shoots are developed from the axils of its foliage-leaves. These and
all following shoots have a similar structure; each of them bears
a pair of scale-leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig542">542</a> <i>A</i>, <i>a</i>) and a pair of
foliage-leaves (Fig.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[504]</span> <a href="#fig542">542</a> <i>A</i>, <i>b</i>), and then terminates its
growth, if it does not produce an inflorescence; new lateral shoots
proceed from the axils of the foliage-leaves, and the branching, in
consequence, is extremely regular and falsely dichotomous. Only one
internode (shoot-generation) is formed each year, so that each fork
indicates one year. The foliage-leaves fall off in the second year.
The inflorescence is a 3(-5)-flowered dichasium (Fig. <a href="#fig542">542</a> <i>A</i>,
<i>m</i> is the central flower, <i>n</i> the lateral). The plants are
<i>diœcious</i>; the ♂-flower as a rule is 2-merous: perianth 2 + 2,
each leaf of which bears on its inner side 6–20 pollen-sacs, each of
which opens by a pore; this relationship may be considered to have
arisen from the union of the perianth-leaves with the multilocular
stamens (2 + 2) placed opposite them. The ♀-flowers always have
Pr 2 + 2, G2.&mdash;<i>Loranthus</i> is also found in Europe (it has
a 3-merous flower), especially in the central and south-eastern
districts, on <i>Quercus cerris</i> and <i>Q. pubescens</i>; but
the great majority of the 520 species grow in the Tropics on trees
which they ornament with their often brightly-coloured flowers, and
ultimately kill when present in too great numbers. The pollination in
the numerous Loranthaceæ with unisexual flowers, is effected by the
wind. In <i>Viscum album</i> this takes place in autumn, the actual
fertilisation in the following spring, and the maturity in November
or December; in the succeeding month of May the berry is ready to
germinate, and falls off.</span></p>

rare tropical plants extends, they have thalloid organs of
vegetation resembling the root-like strands of <i>Viscum</i>,

live in and on the tissues of the host-plant, from which their

<h3 class="smaller">Sub-Class 2. <b>Sympetalæ.</b></h3>

<p>The characters which separate this from the first Sub-class, the
Choripetalæ, have been described on page <a href="#Page_336">336</a>. They consist in the
following: the flower is always verticillate, generally with <b>5</b>
sepals, <b>5</b> petals, <b>5</b> stamens, and <b>2</b> carpels (in the
median plane), the calyx is generally persistent and gamosepalous, the
corolla is gamopetalous and united to the stamens, which are therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[505]</span>
adnate to it, the ovules have only <i>one</i> thick integument and a
small nucellus. (The exceptions are noted later.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This Sub-class is no doubt more recent than the Choripetalæ; it
is also peculiar in including fewer trees and shrubby forms than
the latter.</p>
</div>

<p>The Sympetalæ may be separated into 2 sections:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Pentacyclicæ (five-whorled).</span> The flowers in this
section have 5 <i>whorls equal in number</i>, namely, 2 staminal whorls
in addition to the calyx, corolla, and carpels; in some instances,
one of the staminal whorls is rudimentary or entirely suppressed, but
in this case it is frequently the sepal-stamens which are suppressed,
and the whorl which is present stands opposite the petals. The flowers
are regular. The <i>number of carpels equals that of the sepals</i>,
but in one of the orders (<i>Bicornes</i>) they are opposite the
petals (the flower being obdiplostemonous); in the other two orders
(<i>Primulinæ</i> and <i>Diospyrinæ</i>) they are placed opposite the
sepals (the flower being diplostemonous). This section is the most
closely allied to the Choripetalæ, since the petals may sometimes
be found entirely free, and the stamens inserted directly on the
receptacle (Ericaceæ); ovules with two integuments are also found.
<span class="smaller">It is very doubtful, whether the orders included under this head
have any relationship with the other Sympetalæ. They appear in any case
to represent older types.</span></p>

<p><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Tetracyclicæ (four-whorled).</span> The flowers have only
4 whorls, namely, beside sepals, petals, and carpels, only one whorl
of stamens, which alternates with the petals; there is no trace of
the second staminal whorl, and when the number of carpels is the same
as that of the preceding whorls (“isomerous”) they alternate with
the stamens; but in most cases there are 2 <i>carpels placed in the
median plane</i> (see the diagrams, <i>e.g.</i> Figs. <a href="#fig559">559</a>, <a href="#fig567">567</a>, <a href="#fig583">583</a>,
<a href="#fig590">590</a>, etc.). This section is the largest, and the one which shows the
characteristics of the Sympetalæ best. Very irregular flowers are met
with.</p>

<p>The following families belong to the <b>Pentacyclicæ</b>: 26,
<i>Bicornes</i>; 27, <i>Diospyrinæ</i>; 28, <i>Primulinæ</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining families belonging to the <b>Tetracyclicæ</b> are:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>a.</b> <span class="smcap">Hypogynous</span> flowers (with a few exceptions): 29,
<i>Tubifloræ</i>; 30, <i>Personatæ</i>; 31, <i>Nuculiferæ</i>; 32,
<i>Contortæ</i>.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> <span class="smcap">Epigynous</span> flowers: 33, <i>Rubiales</i>; 34,
<i>Dipsacales</i>; 35, <i>Campanulinæ</i>; 36, <i>Aggregatæ</i>. The
ovaries and ovules in the last family are always reduced to one; and at
the same time the fruits become nuts, and the flowers are united into
crowded inflorescences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[506]</span></p>

<h3 class="smaller"><b>A. Pentacyclicæ</b>.</h3>

<h4>Family 26. <b>Bicornes.</b></h4>

<p>This family is chiefly composed of shrubs, less frequently of small
trees, or perennial herbs; their leaves are undivided, most frequently
evergreen, stiff and leathery, and always without stipules. The flowers
are ☿ and <i>regular</i>, rarely slightly zygomorphic, most frequently
obdiplostemonous, and 4- or 5-merous through all the 5 whorls. <i>The
stamens are attached to the receptacle</i>, and as a rule are quite
free from the petals, an attachment which is very rare among the
Gamopetalæ. They have a simple gynœceum with <i>one</i> undivided
style, a commissural stigma, and a <i>multilocular</i> ovary, whose
axile placentæ project considerably into the loculi, and bear a large
number of ovules. <span class="smaller">The placentæ are sometimes not united, and in
consequence, the ovary is 1-locular with incomplete partition-walls,
<i>e.g. Pyrola</i>, <i>Monotropa</i>.</span> Embryo straight, with
endosperm. <i>The carpels are placed opposite the petals.</i></p>

<p>The <i>diagram</i> is generally Sn, Pn, An + n, Gn, in which n is
4 or 5. To this may be added, that the <i>corolla is in most cases
gamopetalous</i>, but in some (especially <i>Pyrolaceæ</i>) perfectly
polypetalous; and that the <i>anthers usually open by pores</i>, and
often have <i>two horn-like</i> appendages (hence the name “Bicornes”)
(Figs. <a href="#fig545">545</a>, <a href="#fig546">546</a>); frequently the two halves of the anther are also
widely separated from each other at the upper end, so that the pores
are placed each one at the end of its own tube (Fig. <a href="#fig546">546</a>); the
pollen-grains in the majority are united into <i>tetrads</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig542">542</a>
<i>D</i>).&mdash;The flowers, as a rule, are pendulous and borne in racemes,
coloured (red or white), but odourless. When the fruit is a capsule,
the placenta with the seeds attached persists as a central column. A
<i>mycorhiza</i> occurs on many.</p>

<p>The majority of plants belonging to this family inhabit cold and
temperate countries, or high mountains in tropical regions; they prefer
cold and dry or damp places (bogs, heaths, etc.). Plentiful in N.
America.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Pyrolaceæ.</b> Perennial <i>herbs</i>; <i>petals most
frequently quite free from each other</i>, and falling off singly
after flowering; <i>the anthers are without appendages</i>, and open
by pores (Fig. <a href="#fig544">544</a>), or by a transverse slit. The placentæ are thick.
The seeds in the <i>capsule-like</i> fruit (loculicidal dehiscence)
are exceedingly small and light, they have a sac-like testa which
loosely envelops them, an oily endosperm, and an <i>extremely simple
embryo</i>, which consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[507]</span> only of an ellipsoidal, cellular mass,
without cotyledons or differentiation into plumule and radicle.</p>

<p><i>Pyrola</i> (Winter-green) is green, and has also large evergreen
foliage-leaves. The flowers, 5-merous, are most frequently borne in
racemes without a terminal flower; the anthers are extrorse in the
bud with the pores in the lower portion (Fig. <a href="#fig544">544</a> <i>A</i>), but they
become inverted at a later period, so that the pores open at the top
(Fig. <a href="#fig544">544</a> <i>C</i>). <span class="smaller"><i>P. uniflora</i> has a single, terminal
flower; it winters by its roots, producing from these in the spring
aerial, quite unbranched shoots. <i>Chimaphila umbellata.</i></span></p>

  </div>

<p><i>Monotropa</i> (Yellow Bird’s-nest) is very pale yellow, without
chlorophyll, succulent, and has only scale-like leaves closely pressed
upon the stem; it is a saprophyte. The raceme has a terminal flower,
and is pendulous before flowering. The anthers open by a semicircular,
transverse cleft. <span class="smaller"><i>M. hypopitys</i> reproduces chiefly by
root-shoots.</span></p>

<p>About 30 species, especially N. Europe, N. America, and N. Asia.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Ericaceæ.</b> The flower (Fig. <a href="#fig545">545</a>) is <i>hypogynous</i>,
the median sepal posterior; corolla, <i>gamopetalous</i>; the stamens
are generally <i>2-horned</i>, and the fruit is a <i>capsule</i>,
less frequently a berry or drupe. At the base of the ovary is a
nectar-secreting disc (Fig. <a href="#fig545">545</a> <i>B</i>). This order comprises shrubs
or undershrubs (rarely small trees), which are evergreen, and as a rule
have densely crowded leaves.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">Ericeæ, Heath Group.</span> Flowers most frequently
<i>4-merous</i> (S4, P4, A4 + 4, G4, united in a 4-locular gynœceum),
rarely 5-merous. The withered corolla <i>persists</i> after flowering.
The leaves are most frequently acicular, opposite or verticillate; the
buds are without scales. The fruit is a capsule.&mdash;<i>Calluna</i> (<i>C.

the coloured calyx; capsule with septicidal dehiscence.&mdash;<i>Erica</i>
(about 420 species; <i>E. tetralix</i>, Cross-leaved Heath) has a
tubular or bell-shaped, 4-dentate corolla, which is much longer than
the calyx. Capsule with loculicidal dehiscence.&mdash;<i>Pentapera.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[508]</span></p>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">Andromedeæ.</span> The flowers are 5-merous (S5, P5, A5

loculi. <i>Arbutus</i> (<i>A. unedo</i>, Strawberry-tree) has a
spherical berry.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Pollination</i> is effected by means of insects, especially
by bees. The pollen is light and dry, and is shaken out
through the pores of the anthers when the insects agitate the
horn-like appendages during their visits. Self-pollination
takes place, no doubt, in many cases.&mdash;800 species; the very

</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Rhodoraceæ</b> (<b>Rhododendrons</b>). This differs from
the preceding order in the <i>median sepal being anterior</i>, and
hence the position of the other floral whorls is also reversed. The
flower is <i>hypogynous</i>, in most cases 5-merous; the corolla is
most frequently deeply cleft or polypetalous, and falls off after
flowering; the anthers open by pores, and have <i>no horn-like
appendages</i>. <i>Capsule</i> with <i>septicidal</i> dehiscence.&mdash;The
shrubs or small trees belonging to this order have, like the Vaccineæ,
ordinary foliage-leaves, and the buds are generally provided with
<i>large bud-scales</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rhododendron</i> has 10 stamens, and a slightly zygomorphic
flower with deeply 5-cleft corolla (the section <i>Azalea</i> has
frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[509]</span> only 5 stamens, the petal-stamens being absent). They
are Alpine plants (200 species) in the mountains of Asia, especially
the Himalayas; some in S. Europe.&mdash;<i>Menziesia.</i>&mdash;<i>Ledum</i>;
small, rusty-brown, hairy shrubs with polypetalous, expanded, star-like
corolla.&mdash;<i>Kalmia</i> (N. Am.) has a cupular corolla, with 10 small,
pocket-like depressions in which the anthers are concealed until the
arched, elastic filaments are freed from this position by means of
the insects, when they quickly straighten themselves in the centre
of the flower.&mdash;<i>Phyllodoce</i>; <i>Loiseleuria</i> (5 stamens);
(<i>Clethra</i> (?); also placed among the Ternstrœmiaceæ).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

of the corolla. Pollen-grains single. Disc absent. Capsule
loculicidal.&mdash;9 species from the Arctic regions. It is doubtful
whether this order should be included in the Bicornes; perhaps
it would be more correctly assigned to the <i>Polemoniaceæ</i>.</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Epacridaceæ.</b> This order comprises those species
of the family which are confined to Australia and the South Sea
Islands. They are shrub-like plants, resembling the Ericaceæ in
habit, in the inflorescence, and in the structure, form, and
colour of the flower. They differ especially in having only 1
<i>whorl of stamens</i> (placed opposite the sepals) and in the
anthers having only 2 loculi, and opening by a longitudinal

fruit a berry</i>. The latter is most frequently spherical, and bears
on its apex the calyx, which is generally very low, almost entire, and
with a <i>disc-like expansion</i> inside. The flower is 4- or 5-merous
(Fig. <a href="#fig546">546</a> <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>). The anthers have 2 pores, and are most

<h4>Family 27. <b>Diospyrinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers are <i>regular</i>, gamopetalous, typically diplostemonous,
with the same number throughout all 5 whorls, thus: Sn, Pn, An + n,
Gn, where n most frequently =5 (4–6), rarely 3, 7 or 8. Of the two
whorls of stamens the one opposite the sepals is often present only
as rudiments or is entirely suppressed, and the completely developed
<i>stamens are thus placed opposite the petals</i>. The carpels are
generally placed opposite the sepals. The <i>ovary is multilocular</i>
with the ovules attached in the inner angles. The fruit is most
frequently a <i>berry</i>. The seeds are large, generally solitary,
or a few in each loculus.&mdash;All plants belonging to this family are
<i>trees</i> or shrubs with <i>scattered</i>, <i>single</i>, <i>most
frequently entire</i>, <i>penninerved</i> and <i>leathery</i> leaves
without stipules; the majority are tropical (America, Asia), some are
found in N. Am. and the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Sapotaceæ.</b> Plants with latex; anthers extrorse,
1 <i>erect</i> ovule in each loculus; fruit a berry; the
seeds with bony, shiny brown testa have a large, lateral
hilum. The leaves are frequently covered with silky hairs.&mdash;A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[511]</span>
useful order in several respects (400 tropical species).
The wood of some genera, such as <i>Sideroxylon</i> (Iron
wood) and <i>Bumelia</i>, is as hard as iron. The latex of
<i>Palaquium</i> (<i>P. oblongifolium</i>, <i>P. gutta</i>, and
other species), <i>Mimusops</i> and <i>Payena</i> (Sumatra, E.
Ind.), is the raw material of <i>gutta percha</i>. The following
have very delicious fruits: <i>Lucuma mammosa</i>, <i>Achras
sapota</i>, <i>Chrysophyllum cainito</i> (Star-apple), etc. The
seeds of <i>Bassia</i> (E. Ind.) contain a large quantity of a
fatty oil. <i>Isonandra</i>, <i>Mimusops schimperi</i> are often
found in the Egyptian royal tombs.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Ebenaceæ.</b> Plants without latex, often diœcious;
flowers with a more or less leathery perianth. The number of
stamens is sometimes increased (by splitting?); ovules 1–2,
<i>pendulous</i> in each loculus. Fruit a berry.&mdash;250 species;
chiefly tropical. Some are well known on account of their hard

<p>Order 3. <b>Styracaceæ.</b> The flower is more or less
<i>epigynous</i>, and the corolla is almost <i>polypetalous</i>.
The stamens (by splitting?) are more than double the number
of the petals, and often united at the base. Stellate hairs
are frequent.&mdash;235 species; Tropical Asia and America, a few
for example in the East.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Officinal</span>: Gum-benzoin from

<h4>Family 28. <b>Primulinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers are <i>regular</i>, ☿, <i>hypogynous</i>, and gamopetalous.
The <i>stamens</i> are <i>equal in number</i> to the petals (Fig. <a href="#fig547">547</a>)
and <i>are placed opposite to them</i>. The ovary is <i>unilocular</i>,
with <i>a free, central</i> placenta with 1–many ovules.&mdash;The flower
is a further development of the Diospyrinæ; the suppression of the
calyx-stamens, which commenced in this family, is carried further
in the Primulinæ, so that in the majority of cases no trace of them
is present, but in certain species and genera (<i>Samolus</i>,
<i>Lysimachia thyrsiflora</i>, <i>Soldanella</i>, certain Myrsineæ)
some small bodies (scales, teeth, etc.) are found in the position of
the suppressed stamens. Again, the lateral portions of the carpels
are suppressed, so that the <i>ventral placentæ</i> with the ovules
are separated from the dorsal portions, and <i>are united into a
free central placenta</i>; this theory is supported by the branching
of the vascular bundles, the development, and various comparative
considerations.&mdash;Sn, Pn, A0 + n, Gn; where n = 4–8, generally 5. The
carpels are placed opposite the sepals (Fig. <a href="#fig547">547</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[512]</span></p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Primulaceæ</b> (<b>Primroses</b>). This order has <i>many
ovules</i> attached to a <i>thick, free, central placenta</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig547">547</a>); <i>style undivided</i> with a <i>capitate</i> stigma; ovules
semi-anatropous; fruit a <i>capsule</i> with many seeds.</p>

<p>All the plants belonging to this order are <i>herbs</i>; stipules
wanting; the flower is most frequently 5-merous (S5, P5, A0 + 5, G5;
except <i>Centunculus</i> and <i>Trientalis</i>). The corolla and
capsule have various forms, but the capsule generally opens by teeth at
the apex. The ovules are semi-anatropous (in <i>Hottonia</i> they are
anatropous), and the seeds are therefore <i>peltate</i>, with the hilum
situated in the centre of one side. The endosperm is fleshy or horny.
The flowers are borne either in racemes or in umbels; as <i>bracteoles
are typically</i> absent (Fig. <a href="#fig547">547</a>), cymose branching does not occur.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Plumbaginaceæ.</b> This order has a position of the stamens
similar to that in Primulaceæ (S5, P5, A0 + 5, G5), but it differs from
these in the flower, which has generally a <i>membranous</i>, dry,
thin, coloured, folded, almost entire calyx and an <i>almost entirely
polypetalous corolla</i>, which, as a rule, has twisted æstivation
and is <i>only united</i> with the stamens <i>at its base</i>; but
more especially it differs in the ovary, which bears 5 <i>free</i>
or almost free <i>styles</i> and only 1 <i>basal</i> ovule with a
<i>long</i>, twisted funicle (the placenta of the Primulaceæ is here so
much reduced that it bears only 1 ovule). The fruit is a <i>nut</i> or
<i>capsule</i>. The radicle is turned outwards. Endosperm mealy.&mdash;To
this order belong herbs or under-shrubs, which are especially natives
of the sea-coast and of salt-steppes; they also resemble the Primulaceæ
in the scattered, undivided, entire leaves (without stipules), often in
rosettes, and the inflorescence borne on a long stalk. In opposition to
the Primulaceæ, the <i>bracteoles are typically present, and hence the
branching is generally cymose</i> (scorpioid).</p>

<p><i>Armeria</i> (Thrift) has a round <i>capitulum</i>, composed of
closely-packed dichasia, surrounded at its base by an involucre with
peculiar prolongations, directed downwards, and united into a sheath
protecting the intercalary zone of growth. The pericarp is finally
ruptured at the base, and drops off like a hood.&mdash;In <i>Statice</i>

collected into panicle-like inflorescences.&mdash;<span class="smaller"><i>Plumbago</i> is
the genus which approaches nearest to the Primulaceæ, and differs
most from the characters given above. It has capitate or spike-like

<p>The flower is regular, ☿, and <i>hypogynous</i>. The gamopetalous type
is present in this family with great uniformity, without suppression
or splitting; S5, P5, A5, G2 (3–5). The stamens are all fertile,
alternating with the lobes of the corolla. Gynœceum with 2, more
seldom 3–5 syncarpous carpels. Style nearly always simple; 2 dorsal
stigmas. In each carpel 2–∞ ovules. At the base of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[515]</span> ovary is
found a yellowish ring-like nectary (Fig. <a href="#fig552">552</a> C), sometimes 5-sinuate

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Order 1. <b>Polemoniaceæ.</b> The flowers are regular; S5, P5,
A5, G3. The calyx and corolla have united leaves, the petals
<i>twisted</i> to the right in <i>æstivation</i> (all the left
edges being covered). The ovary is 3-locular with 2–∞ ovules
in each loculus; the style is trifid at the apex; the fruit
is a 3-valved capsule. Embryo straight; endosperm fleshy. The
inflorescences are dichasia passing over into unipared helicoid

<p>Order 2. <b>Hydrophyllaceæ.</b> This order approaches very
closely to the Boraginaceæ. Herbs with pinnate or palmate
leaves; S5, P5, A5, G2. The lobes of the corolla are imbricate
in æstivation. Generally 2 median carpels. The ovary is
<i>most frequently unilocular</i>, and the seeds are situated
on 2 <i>parietal placentæ</i>; capsule 2-valved; embryo
straight; endosperm fleshy. In the corolla-tube, opposite the
corolla-lobes, there are frequently appendages of various forms,
which resemble those of <i>Cuscuta</i>. The inflorescences
correspond exactly with those of the Boraginaceæ, being
<i>unipared scorpioid cymes</i>, which, prior to opening,
<i>are tightly rolled up</i>.&mdash;130 species, especially in N.
Am. (California, etc.). Many annual species of <i>Phacelia</i>,

<p>Order 3. <b>Convolvulaceæ</b> (<b>Bindweeds</b>). The flower
is regular, hypogynous, with 5 almost free sepals (quincuncial
æstivation), P5, A5, G2 (rarely 3–5). The <i>corolla</i> is very
characteristic; it is (with various forms) almost entire, or slightly
5-lobed, and <i>folded</i> longitudinally <i>in the bud</i> in such
a way that 5 projecting, flat portions, tapering towards the top and
frequently differing in colour and hairiness from the rest, are visible
externally and applied close together, while the remainder of the
corolla is folded inwards (Fig. <a href="#fig552">552</a> A); and hence the whole corolla
is <i>strongly twisted to the right</i> in the bud. The gynœceum most
frequently has a bilocular ovary; <i>in each loculus</i> there are
<i>only</i> 2 (erect) <i>anatropous ovules</i> on the placenta, which
is not especially thickened (Fig. <a href="#fig552">552</a> <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>); each loculus
is sometimes divided into two by a false septum (a relationship with
the <i>Boraginaceæ</i>, etc.); style simple with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[516]</span> most frequently a
bilobed stigma, or a bipartite style. The fruit is nearly spherical,
most frequently a <i>capsule</i>. The seeds are erect, and have a large

which they raise themselves to other portions of their host or try
to reach other plants. On germination a very temporary primary root
is developed, which bears root-hairs as far as the tip (rootcap is
wanting); it only serves as a kind of reservoir for water, and perishes
very soon after the seedling has fastened on to a host. The embryo
is filamentous and rolled up <i>spirally</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig553">553</a> <i>C</i>),

<h4>Family 30. <b>Personatæ.</b></h4>

<p>The type of the flower is: S5, P5, A5 (of which one, or in some cases
several, are suppressed), and G2. The flowers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[518]</span> <i>hypogynous</i>,
☿, perfect with gamopetalous corolla, but most frequently irregular
(medianly zygomorphic, except <i>Solanaceæ</i>), the <i>corolla</i>
being <i>bilabiate</i> (divided into a posterior part of two lobes
and an anterior part of three lobes), and the <i>stamens</i> 4,
<i>didynamous</i> (the posterior being suppressed). The ovary has
2 loculi (only 1 in <i>Utriculariaceæ</i>, <i>Gesneriaceæ</i>,
<i>Orobanche</i>); the placenta in the first-named orders (1–7) is most
frequently very thick, and bears a <i>great many ovules</i> (Figs.
<a href="#fig554">554</a>, <a href="#fig555">555</a>, <a href="#fig557">557</a>, <a href="#fig562">562</a>); the number of ovules in the last orders (8–9) is
considerably reduced (Fig. <a href="#fig570">570</a>).</p>

<p>Special mention may be made of the apparently 4-merous flower which
is found, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Veronica</i> and <i>Plantago</i> (Figs.
<a href="#fig567">567</a>, <a href="#fig562">562</a> <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig570">570</a>, <a href="#fig571">571</a>), and which arises from the typical
5-merous flower by the suppression of the posterior sepal and the
posterior stamen, and by the union of the two posterior petals into
one.&mdash;Terminal flowers very seldom occur on the main axis, and would
not harmonise well with the very irregular form of the flower. When
they do occur, they are, as a rule, “peloric,” <i>i.e.</i> regular (in
<i>Linaria vulgaris</i> two kinds of peloric flowers occur,&mdash;one with
5 spurs, and one without spurs). The halves of the anthers are often
divided as far as the base, and laterally so widely separated from each
other as to assume an almost straight line (Figs. <a href="#fig563">563</a>, <a href="#fig564">564</a>). There is
generally a nectary (“disc”) round the base of the ovary, often 5-lobed
(or divided into free glands).&mdash;A common vegetative characteristic is
the <i>absence of stipules</i>.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Solanaceæ.</b> The flower (Figs. <a href="#fig554">554</a>, <a href="#fig555">555</a>, <a href="#fig559">559</a>) is
hypogynous, regular (zygomorphic in <i>Hyoscyamus</i>), ☿, and
gamopetalous, with S5, P5 (most frequently <i>imbricate</i> or
<i>valvate</i>), A5, G2, the 2 carpels being placed obliquely (Fig.
<a href="#fig554">554</a>); the bilocular ovary has a very <i>thick axile placenta</i> (Figs.
<a href="#fig554">554</a>, <a href="#fig555">555</a> <i>H</i>, 557), which extends almost as far as the wall of
the ovary. The fruit is a capsule or berry; the seeds are more or less
reniform, and the embryo is <i>curved</i> (rarely straight), in a
fleshy endosperm (Figs. <a href="#fig555">555</a> <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>; <a href="#fig561">561</a>).&mdash;Both arborescent
and herbaceous forms are found in the order; leaves scattered without
stipules,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[519]</span> but with variously formed laminæ (always penninerved). <i>A
peculiar leaf-arrangement</i> is found in many species, viz. the leaves
are borne <i>in pairs, a large and a smaller one together</i>; these
pairs stand in 2 rows, and the flowers are then situated <i>between</i>
the individual leaves in each pair, apparently <i>not</i> in a leaf
axil. The inflorescences are frequently unipared scorpioid cymes
without floral-leaves.</p>

<p>Zygomorphic flowers occur, and thus form a transition to the
closely allied Scrophulariaceæ; the zygomorphy sometimes shows
itself only in the relative length of the stamens, sometimes
also in the corolla (<i>Hyoscyamus</i>).&mdash;<i>Nicandra</i> is
5-merous throughout all the whorls.&mdash;The peculiar relative
<i>leaf-arrangement</i> in this order occurs from sympodial
branching and displacement. The most simple is, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Datura</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig556">556</a> <i>A</i>); each shoot-generation
in the floral parts of the plant has only 2 foliage-leaves
(<i>f<sup>1</sup></i> and <i>f<sup>2</sup></i>), and then terminates in a flower;
the axillary buds of both the foliage-leaves are developed
and form a dichasium, but since the leaves are displaced on
their axillary-shoots as far, or almost as far, as the first
leaf of these axillary-shoots, the flowers are borne singly
on the dichasial branches, and all the branches appear to be
without subtending leaves (Shoot I is white, II shaded, III
white, etc., diagram <i>A</i>). <i>Scopolia</i> and others
(Fig. <a href="#fig556">556</a> <i>B</i>) differ in that the lowest and smallest
(<i>f<sup>1</sup></i>) of the two leaves on each shoot is barren, and
is therefore not displaced; but the upper one (the second
bracteole, <i>f<sup>2</sup></i>) is displaced as in the first instance,
and consequently it assumes a position near the first leaf
(the shaded leaf <i>f<sup>2</sup></i> of shoot I being placed near the
white leaf <i>f<sup>1</sup></i> of shoot II, etc.,) of the next youngest
shoot-generation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[520]</span> and hence the leaves are borne in pairs; the
flower placed between the two leaves of a pair is therefore the
terminal flower of the shoot to which the smaller of the two
leaves belongs, and the larger leaf is the subtending leaf for
the floral shoot itself.</p>

<p>About 1,500 species; the majority within the Tropics, outside
these limits especially in America. <i>Solanum nigrum</i>
is a common weed.&mdash;<i>The Potato-plant</i> (<i>Solanum
tuberosum</i>), from Peru and Chili, was introduced into
Europe in 1584 by Sir Walter Raleigh. (Potatoes = Batatos).
The fruits of several serve as <i>condiments</i>: Chilies or
Pod-pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> and <i>longum</i>), and the
Cayenne-pepper (<i>C. baccatum</i> and others), whose fruits
also are officinal, were brought to Europe from S. America by
Columbus, and are commonly cultivated in Tropical America;
<i>Lycopersicum esculentum</i> (Tomato) and others from Peru;
<i>Solanum ovigerum</i> (Egg-plant); <i>Solanum melongena</i>,
etc. <i>Poisonous</i>, <i>acrid</i>, <i>narcotic</i> properties
(alkaloids, etc., solanine, nicotine, atropine, hyoscyamine)
are found in many: <i>Atropa belladonna</i> (from S. Europe;
the roots and leaves are officinal); <i>Solanum dulcamara</i>
(Bitter-sweet; formerly officinal), <i>S. toxicarium</i>
(Guiana); <i>Datura stramonium</i> from Asia (leaves and seeds
officinal), <i>D. sanguinea</i>, <i>metel</i>, <i>tatula</i>,
and others; <i>Hyoscyamus</i> (officinal: the leaves and seeds
of <i>H. niger</i>); <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> (Virginian
tobacco, officinal: the leaves), <i>N. rustica</i> and others
from Trop. America (<i>Tobacco</i> was introduced into Europe
in 1560); <i>Cestrum</i>-species. <i>Duboisia myoporoides</i>
(Australia); the leaves contain <i>hyoscyamine</i> and are used
in medicine. A number of species of these genera are ornamental
plants.</p>

<p>Order 2. <b>Nolanaceæ.</b> These most resemble the Convolvulaceæ
in the corolla, but the Solanaceæ in their branching, and
leaf-arrangement (in pairs, etc.). The diagram is the same as
in <i>Nicandra</i> with 5 carpels, but the fruits of this order
most frequently form, by invaginations in various directions,
an ovary (with 1 style) consisting of numerous and irregularly
grouped, 1-ovuled cells; the fruit is a schizocarp with many
1-seeded fruitlets.&mdash;<i>Nolana</i> (Western S. America): a few
are ornamental plants.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 3. <b>Scrophulariaceæ.</b> The flower is hypogynous, ☿,
<i>zygomorphic</i>, with the usual type: S5, P5, A5, and G2, the
latter placed <i>in the median plane</i>; some genera have all 5
stamens developed (Fig. <a href="#fig562">562</a> <i>A</i>), but most frequently the
posterior one is suppressed and the flower becomes <i>didynamous</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig562">562</a> <i>B</i>). The fruit, as in the capsular-fruited Solanaceæ,
is a bilocular, 2-valved <i>capsule</i>, with a <i>thick, axile
placenta</i>, and most often septicidal dehiscence (Fig. <a href="#fig563">563</a> <i>C</i>).
The <i>numerous seeds</i> are not reniform as in many Solanaceæ, and
have a <i>straight, or only slightly curved embryo</i>, with abundant
endosperm (Fig. <a href="#fig563">563</a> <i>D</i>).&mdash;The majority are herbs; some are
arborescent; the leaves are opposite or scattered, but stipules are
wanting as in the whole family.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Scrophulariaceæ are closely allied to the Solanaceæ, and
there is, properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[523]</span> speaking, no characteristic feature which
absolutely separates them. The somewhat irregular corolla,
with five stamens of unequal length in <i>Verbascum</i>, is
also found in <i>Hyoscyamus</i>; curved and straight embryos
are found in both orders. The activation of the corolla in the
Scrophulariaceæ is <i>simple imbricate</i>, in the Solanaceæ
most frequently <i>folded imbricate</i> (in <i>Atropa</i> and
those allied to it, imbricate without folding). The genera
(about 164) are distinguished according to the form of the
corolla, number of stamens, inflorescence, arrangement of the
leaves, etc. <i>Verbascum</i> belongs to the most primitive
5-stamened forms, and from it proceed a long series down to
<i>Veronica</i>, with only two stamens and most frequently the
posterior sepal suppressed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mechanical contrivances for <span class="allsmcap">POLLINATION</span> are so
numerous that no general principle can be laid down. Personate
flowers, like those of <i>Antirrhinum</i> are only accessible to
strong insects, such as humble-bees, which can force themselves
between the two lips, and so become dusted with pollen on
the back. In <i>Euphrasia</i> and other <i>Rhinantheæ</i>
the insects become covered with smooth, powdery pollen when
they shake the anther-apparatus in touching the hairs and
bristles mentioned above. <i>Scrophularia nodosa</i> is
protogynous (Fig. <a href="#fig565">565</a>). <i>Digitalis purpurea</i>, however,
is protandrous. <i>Mimulus luteus</i> and some others have
sensitive stigmatic lobes, which shut up on being touched. The
<i>Veronica</i>-species constitute a series, from large-flowered
down to small-flowered forms, and parallel with them are found
various gradations from insect-to self-pollination. In some (as
<i>Euphrasia officinalis</i>, <i>Rhinanthus crista galli</i>)
there are two kinds of flowers: large, which are pollinated
by insects, and small, which are self-pollinated (Fig. <a href="#fig568">568</a>).
<i>Lathræa squamaria</i> (Tooth-wort) is a protogynous
spring-flowering plant, largely visited by humble-bees. Others

are placed 4 bristles <i>h</i>; <i>k</i> stalk of the bladder, in which
is seen a vascular bundle. (After Cohn.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Order 4. <b>Utriculariaceæ.</b> To this order belong only perennial,
<i>insectivorous</i>, <i>aquatic</i>, and <i>marsh-plants</i> (200
species) with a more or less characteristic appearance. They differ
from the Scrophulariaceæ, especially in having <b>2</b> stamens
(the anterior) and a <i>unilocular ovary</i>, with <i>free, central
placenta</i> (like that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[528]</span> Primulaceæ). For the rest the flower
is distinctly bilabiate, both in the calyx and corolla. Two-valved
capsule; no endosperm.</p>

<p><i>Pinguicula</i> (Butter-wort) has a rosette of leaves close to the
ground; these are sticky, covered with glandular hairs, and roll round
any small insects which may be caught upon them; flowers solitary,
terminal on a long scape; calyx, 5-partite; corolla with spur. The
embryo germinates with 1 cotyledon.&mdash;<i>Utricularia</i> (Bladder-wort).
Our native species are floating, <i>without roots</i>, with hair-like,
divided leaves, studded with peculiar bladders (in the Tropics there
are terrestrial species, with ordinary foliage). The bladders (Fig.
<a href="#fig569">569</a>) have an aperture, closed by a valve opening inwards, so that small
aquatic animals are allowed to enter, but are not able to escape; they
are thus entrapped in the bladders, and are probably used as food.
Calyx bipartite; corolla personate with spur.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>embryo</i> of <i>Utricularia</i> is very imperfect,
scarcely more than a spherical, cellular mass, with a few slight
leaf-rudiments. On the germination of <i>U. vulgaris</i>,
several bristle-like leaves develop into a compact rosette; the
stem then develops, and also the finely-divided, bladder-bearing
leaves. A primary root is not developed. The stems branch
copiously and in a very peculiar manner. The growing-point of
the stem is rolled spirally.&mdash;The stigmatic lobes are sensitive
and close on being touched; self-pollination often takes place,
however, in <i>Pinguicula</i>.</p>

<p>Order 5. <b>Gesneriaceæ.</b> The flower in this order may be
both <i>epigynous</i> (<i>Gesnerieæ</i>) and <i>hypogynous</i>
(<i>Cyrtandreæ</i>), but otherwise is nearly the same as in
Scrophulariaceæ, only that <i>the ovary is unilocular</i>,
with 2 <i>parietal</i>, often bifid, <i>placentæ</i>. Of the
5 stamens the posterior is rudimentary, or (more rarely)
entirely wanting, and the others are didynamous (Cyrtandreæ
have often only 2 stamens); their anthers are generally
glued into a quadrangular mass. The majority are herbs with
juicy stems, opposite, verticillate or scattered leaves
without stipules, often, like the stems, thick and juicy,
soft-haired or glabrous. The corollas are often highly-coloured
(scarlet, red-yellow, etc., and spotted internally), large
and magnificent, so that many species are ornamental plants.
<span class="smcap">Gesnerieæ</span> (often epigynous) have endosperm; S.
Am.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cyrtandreæ</span>, hypogynous, without endosperm; Asia,
S. Africa.&mdash;<i>Streptocarpus</i>, neither the primary root nor
primary shoot attains development; one of the cotyledons dies,
while the other grows and becomes a very large foliage-leaf,
from which spring adventitious roots and adventitious
inflorescences.</p>

<p>500 species. <i>Gloxinia</i>, <i>Achimenes</i>, <i>Gesneria</i>,
<i>Alloplectus</i>, <i>Tydæa</i>, <i>Columnea</i>,
<i>Nægelia</i>, <i>Æschynanthus</i>, and others, especially in
the forests of tropical America. Some are epiphytes on trees,
others prefer the leaf-mould of the forest and crevices of
cliffs. Several genera have peculiar, catkin-like, underground
shoots, with scale-like compact leaves; others have tubers.</p>

<p><i>Orobanche</i> (Broom-rape) is allied to this order as a
<i>parasitic</i> form. It is a parasite on the roots of other
plants, not like <i>Lathræa</i> by means of thin rootbranches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[529]</span>
with haustoria, but growing with the base of its stem in close
contact with its host, and probably even often protruding a kind
of thallus into it, in a manner similar to the Loranthaceæ. Its
aerial shoots are not entirely destitute of chlorophyll, but are
not green; they only bear scale-leaves and terminate in a raceme
or spike-like inflorescence.&mdash;Some <i>Orobanche</i>-species
are detrimental to various cultivated plants (Hemp, Lucerne,
Tobacco, etc.). The flowers are strongly zygomorphic; the
posterior sepal is often wanting, and the anterior are united to
the two lateral ones. Ovary unilocular, as in Gesneraceæ, with 2
or 4 parietal placentæ.&mdash;The exceedingly small seeds have a very
rudimentary embryo, formed of an ellipsoidal, cellular mass,
without indication of cotyledons or other organs.&mdash;About 100
species; especially in the Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Bignoniaceæ.</b> 500 species; nearly all trees and
shrubs, and to a great extent lianes, climbing by tendrils
(modified leaves), which are sometimes terminated by a
special clasping apparatus. These lianes have, as a rule, an
<i>anomalous stem structure</i>, the wood being either divided
into four wedges at right angles to each other, separated
by four grooves filled with secondary wood-parenchyma, or a
greater number of wedges occur, by the cambium ceasing to
form wood in several places. The leaves are most frequently
opposite and compound; the flowers in the main are similar to
the didynamous Scrophulariaceæ, and especially resemble those
of <i>Digitalis purpurea</i>; they are bilabiate, large, and
beautiful, campanulate or trumpet-shaped, many of the prettiest
ornamental plants in the Tropics belonging to this order. The
fruit is most frequently a large, woody, 2-valved, siliqua-like,
septifragal capsule, whose valves separate from the flat and
broad partition-wall, which bears the large, generally winged
seeds: <i>Tecoma</i>; <i>Bignonia</i>.&mdash;In gardens: <i>Catalpa
syringæfolia</i> (Trumpet-wood); <i>Tecoma radicans</i> (from
S. Am.).&mdash;“Palisander”-wood is from <i>Jacaranda</i> (S.
Am.).&mdash;<i>Eccremocarpus</i> (N. Am.) forms, by its unilocular
capsule, a transition to the Gesneriaceæ (<i>E. scaber</i>;
herbaceous).</p>

<p><i>Crescentia</i> is allied to this order; <i>C. cujete</i>
(Calabash) is its best known species. The fruit (unilocular with
2 parietal placentæ) is a very large, spherical or ellipsoidal
berry, with a firm, finally woody outer layer. After the removal
of the juicy interior, these are commonly used as drinking
vessels in Tropical America.</p>

<p>Order 7. <b>Pedaliaceæ.</b> <i>Sesamum</i> (<i>orientale</i> and
<i>indicum</i>); very important oil-plants, which from olden
times have been cultivated in tropical Asia and Africa for food
and as medicinal plants, and are now cultivated in America
also. The seeds are used as a raw material in the manufacture
of soap in Europe.&mdash;To this order also belong <i>Martynia</i>
and <i>Craniolaria</i>, which have a long horned capsule and
sensitive stigmas.&mdash;46 species.</p>

<p>Order 8. <b>Acanthaceæ.</b> 1,500 species; mostly erect,
slender, branched herbs or shrubs, rarely arborescent,
especially in S. Am. and Ind. The branches frequently have
swollen nodes; the leaves are <i>opposite</i>, penninerved,
undivided, more or less lanceolate or elliptical, and generally
leave a distinct scar when they fall off. Stipules are wanting.
The flowers are solitary or in dichasia, which are arranged
in 4-rowed spikes or racemes, each flower with its subtending
bract, which may be brightly coloured, and most frequently
also with two bracteoles. With regard to the corolla (which is
often labiate, in any case irregular, and frequently prettily
coloured), the 2 or 4 didynamous stamens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[530]</span> (of whose anthers one
half is inserted lower than the other, or suppressed) and the
gynœceum, the Acanthaceæ are true Personatæ, approaching most
nearly to the Scrophulariaceæ: they differ from the other orders
especially in the <i>fruit</i>, which is a bilocular, 2-valved,
often elastically dehiscing capsule, which never has more than
2 rows, and in some only 2 seeds in each loculus, the seeds
being often compressed and borne on <i>strong</i>, <i>curved</i>
or <i>hook-like funicles</i> (<i>retinacula</i>) which persist
after dehiscence. <i>Embryo curved without endosperm</i>;
radicle pointed downwards.&mdash;Cleistogamic flowers are found in
several species. Cystoliths are common.</p>

<p>The following grow wild in Europe: <i>Acanthus</i>
(<i>spinosus</i> and <i>mollis</i>, whose pinnatifid leaves
served as models for the capitals of the Corinthian columns).
The posterior sepal is the largest of all the leaves of the
flower, and covers the other parts like a helmet; the 2 anterior
sepals are united, and the two lateral ones are small and
greenish; the corolla has no upper-lip, but only a 3-lobed
under-lip. The anthers are bilocular; the filaments ultimately
become very firm.&mdash;<i>Justicia</i>, <i>Eranthemum</i>,
<i>Goldfussia</i>, <i>Thunbergia</i> (a twiner), <i>Ruellia</i>,
<i>Dicliptera</i>, etc.&mdash;Ornamental plants in conservatories.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 9. <b>Plantaginaceæ</b> (<b>Plantains</b>). The flowers (Figs.
<a href="#fig570">570</a>, <a href="#fig571">571</a>) are regular, ☿, hypogynous, with a <b>4</b>-partite,
persistent calyx, a gamopetalous, <i>scarious</i> corolla with <b>4</b>
projecting lobes, <b>4</b> stamens, incurved in the bud, later on
projecting considerably, about equal in length, and a bilocular ovary
with <i>one</i> long, filamentous, <i>undivided</i>, <i>feathery</i>,
papillose style (see Fig. <a href="#fig571">571</a>). The ovary is most frequently bilocular
with 1–few ovules in each loculus. An hypogynous disc is wanting. The
fruit is a <i>pyxidium</i> with 1–few peltate seeds attached in each
loculus (<i>Littorella</i> is in several respects an exception). All

<p>The labiate-like flowers are in this case entirely
concealed under a regular, apparently 4-merous exterior.
The structure of the flower, however, is the same as in the
<i>Scrophulariaceæ</i>, only the reduction, which is found in
<i>Veronica</i> (compare Figs. <a href="#fig562">562</a> <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig567">567</a> with <a href="#fig570">570</a>,

more equally developed; the posterior petal corresponds to
the bilobed upper-lip; the posterior stamen and the posterior
sepal also are entirely wanting. In the development of the
flower there is no trace of posterior sepal or stamen, and the
posterior petal arises from one primordium, but the two anterior
sepals arise before the lateral ones. The position of sepals and
petals does not agree with that of a true 4-merous flower, which
is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig361">361</a> <i>E.</i> The bracteoles are always

<p><i>Plantago</i> (Plantain, Rib-grass). The foliage-leaves are most
frequently scattered, entire, with curved veins, arranged in a
rosette close to the ground on an unlimited rhizome; the spike-like
inflorescence is borne on a long scape; in some (<i>P. psyllium</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[531]</span>
the leaves are opposite on a stem with well-developed internodes, and
the inflorescences are borne in their axils. The order also presents
a transition from insect-pollinated to wind-pollinated flowers.
<span class="smaller">The flowers are protogynous, wind-pollinated in <i>P. major</i>
and <i>P. lanceolata</i>, partly also in the other species, but
insect pollination also occurs, and <i>P. media</i> has three kinds

an aquatic plant with rosettes of round, awl-like leaves and diclinous
(monœcious) flowers. <span class="smaller">In the axils of the foliage-leaves is a very
short 3-flowered spike, formed by 2 sessile ♀-flowers, and above them
a long-stalked ♂-flower; all the flowers are lateral, the terminal one

<p>The genus <i>Plantago</i> constitutes nearly the entire
order (200 species). Some are widely distributed weeds

<h4>Family 31. <b>Nuculiferæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers are <i>hypogynous</i> and <i>zygomorphic</i> (in
<i>Boraginaceæ</i> and <i>Cordiaceæ</i>, however, they are regular,
except <i>Echium</i> and <i>Anchusa arvensis</i>). The calyx is
gamosepalous, the corolla <i>bilabiate</i> (except in the two orders
mentioned), mostly after 2/3, <i>i.e.</i> divided into a 2-leaved
posterior portion, and a 3-leaved anterior portion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[532]</span> The æstivation
of the corolla is nearly always descending.&mdash;In <i>Boraginaceæ</i>
and <i>Cordiaceæ</i> there are 5 stamens of equal length; in the
other orders 4 didynamous ones, or only 2 fertile; the posterior
stamen is sometimes developed as a staminode, sometimes fertile (in
<i>Stilbaceæ</i>). The ovary is formed of 2 median carpels (except
some <i>Verbenaceæ</i>), with (1-) <b>2</b> ovules on each carpel;
in the majority of the orders it is, however, divided by a false
partition-wall between the dorsal and ventral sutures, into <b>4</b>
<i>loculi</i>, each of which is often raised independently, causing
the style to be situated in the depression between the four lobes
(“gynobasic” style, Figs. <a href="#fig572">572</a>, <a href="#fig573">573</a>, <a href="#fig575">575</a>, <a href="#fig579">579</a>). The fruit in these
orders most frequently becomes a <i>4-partite schizocarp</i> with
<i>nut-like fruitlets</i>. The other orders have a 1(-2)-locular
ovary.&mdash;The leaves are <i>simple, without stipules</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The family is related to (and proceeds from) the
<i>Tubifloræ</i>, especially <i>Convolvulaceæ</i>, which has an
almost similar construction of the ovary. It is doubtful whether
the <i>Cordiaceæ</i> and <i>Boraginaceæ</i> should be classed
with the others.</p>

<p>The orders are: 1, Cordiaceæ; 2. Boraginaceæ; 3, Verbenaceæ; 4,
Labiatæ; 5, Selaginaceæ; 6. Globulariaceæ; 7, Stilbaceæ.</p>

<p>Order 1. <b>Cordiaceæ</b> unites Convolvulaceæ and Boraginaceæ.
Tree-like plants with 5-(4–10) merous flowers, doubly bifid
style, and drupe with 4 or less loculi. No endosperm; cotyledons
folded.&mdash;185 species; tropical.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 2. <b>Boraginaceæ.</b> The vegetative parts are very
characteristic: <i>herbs</i> with <i>cylindrical</i> stems and
<i>scattered</i>, undivided, nearly always sessile, entire leaves,
without stipules, and generally, together with the other green portions
of the plant, covered with stiff hairs, consequently rough and often
even stinging (hence the other name for the order <i>Asperifoliæ</i>).
The inflorescences are <i>unipared scorpioid cymes</i> with the
branches coiled spirally (“helicoid,” Fig. <a href="#fig573">573</a>) before the flowers
open. The flower is perfect, <i>regular</i> (obliquely zygomorphic in
<i>Echium</i> and <i>Anchusa arvensis</i>), hypogynous, gamopetalous:
S5, P5 (often with ligular outgrowths), A5, G2, but each of the two
loculi of the ovary becomes divided by a false partition-wall into two,
each of which contains one <i>pendulous</i> anatropous ovule with the
micropyle turned upwards; the four loculi arch upwards, so that the
ovary becomes 4-lobed, and the style is then, as in the <i>Borageæ</i>,
placed <i>at the base</i> (“gynobasic”) between the four projections
(Figs. <a href="#fig572">572</a>, <a href="#fig573">573</a>). The fruit is a <i>4-partite schizocarp</i> with four
nut-like fruitlets (Fig. <a href="#fig572">572</a>).&mdash;<i>Endosperm is wanting</i> (except in
<i>Heliotropium</i>); the radicle is turned <i>upwards</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">INFLORESCENCES</span> are often double unipared scorpioid
cymes; the bud of the second bracteole is developed, that of
the first suppressed; in some cases both the bracteoles are
suppressed (<i>Myosotis</i>, <i>Omphalodes</i>, etc.), but
in other instances all the first bracteoles (<i>a</i>) only
are suppressed, and the others are then situated in two rows
towards the under side of the coiled axis, while the flowers are
situated on the upper side. Displacement of the branches or of
the floral-leaves sometimes takes place. The flowers are often
red at first, and later on become blue or violet; they hardly
ever have any smell. The fruit entirely resembles that of the
Labiatæ, but the radicle of the latter is turned downwards.
The fruitlets present small differences which have systematic
importance; they are hollow or flat at the base, attached to a
flat or columnar receptacle, etc.</p>

it connects this order with the Cordiaceæ. <i>Heliotropium</i>,

more deeply cleft at the apex than in the others; stamens 2 longer,
2 shorter, and 1 still shorter.&mdash;<i>Cerinthe</i> has a tubular
corolla with five small teeth and two bilocular fruitlets. The
bracts are large and leafy, and, like all the rest of the plant, are
<i>almost glabrous</i>.&mdash;A few <i>Lithospermum</i>-species have a
naked corolla-throat; others have small hairy ligules, which do not
close the corolla-throat. The fruitlets are as hard as stone, owing
to the presence of carbonate of lime and silica.&mdash;<i>Mertensia</i>
(<i>Steenhammera</i>); <i>Arnebia</i>; <i>Nonnea</i> (small ligules).</p>

<p><b>B.</b> The corolla-throat is closed by, or in any case provided
with <i>ligules</i>, <i>i.e.</i> scale-like bodies or small
protuberances, situated in the throat of the corolla <i>opposite</i>

of the petals (Fig. <a href="#fig572">572</a> <i>D</i>).&mdash;The nuts in <i>Cynoglossum</i>

corolla, and prolonged-triangular, pointed ligules.&mdash;<i>Borago</i>
(Borage) has a rotate corolla with projecting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[534]</span> emarginate ligules;
the stamens have a horn-like appendage, projecting upwards from the

(Alkanet, Fig. <a href="#fig572">572</a>). The corolla is salver-shaped; the ligules small,
hairy protuberances. <i>A. (Lycopsis) arvensis</i> has an S-curved

<p><span class="smcap">Cross-pollination</span> is most commonly effected by
insects (especially bees). There are a great many contrivances
for pollination; some flowers are protandrous (<i>Echium
vulgare</i>, <i>Borago officin.</i>), others are heterostylous
(long-and short-styled: <i>Pulmonaria officin.</i>); the corona
(ligules) is a protection against rain, and excludes certain
insects. Some are barren when self-pollinated (<i>Pulmonaria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[535]</span>
officinalis</i>, <i>Echium vulgare</i>); others which have
but little honey, may, failing insect-pollination, fertilise
themselves, and in <i>Myosotis versicolor</i> this regularly
occurs by the growth of the corolla during flowering, so
that the anthers are brought into contact with the stigma.
Honey is secreted on the hypogynous disc.&mdash;About 1,150
species, growing especially in the northern temperate zone,
<i>Mucilage</i> is found (<i>e.g.</i> in the <i>officinal</i>
root of <i>Cynoglossum officinale</i>, in the root of
<i>Symphytum</i>): red <i>dyes</i> are found in some roots
(<i>e.g.</i> Alkanet-root, the root of <i>Alkanna tinctoria</i>,
which is also medicinal; S. E. Europe, Asia Minor); some
are <i>poisonous</i>: <i>Cynoglossum</i>, <i>Echium</i>,

<i>Heliotropium</i> (Peru) is cultivated chiefly on account of
its pleasant scent; essential oils are otherwise very rare.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Verbenaceæ.</b> The majority are shrubs; a few are
herbs or trees (Teak-tree); some are lianes. The branches are
often square. The leaves are opposite or verticillate, without
stipules; in some compound. The inflorescences are racemes,
spikes, capitula, or dichasia. Five sepals; five petals in a
gamopetalous, zygomorphic corolla, which is often bilabiate, but
rarely to such an extent as in the Labiatæ, and the upper lip
in some is larger than the under, in others smaller; stamens
four didynamous, or two; the ovary is entire (not grooved or
divided), 1- or 2-locular, or, as in the Labiatæ, divided into
four loculi with an <i>erect</i> ovule in each, but in some the
anterior carpel is suppressed. One <i>terminal</i> style. The
fruit is, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Verbena</i>, a 4 partite schizocarp
with nut-like fruitlets; in <i>Vitex</i> (digitate leaves) a
drupe with a 4-locular stone; in <i>Clerodendron</i> a similar
fruit, with four free stones; in <i>Lantana</i> a bilocular
stone, or two unilocular stones. The radicle is <i>turned
downwards</i>. Endosperm small or absent.&mdash;<i>Lippia</i>,
<i>Stachytarpheta</i>, <i>Bouchea</i>, <i>Priva</i>,
<i>Citharexylon</i>, <i>Callicarpa</i>, etc.&mdash;The Verbenaceæ are
closely allied to the Labiatæ; they differ especially in the
ovary not being 4-lobed with gynobasic style, but undivided,
almost spherical or ovoid with a terminal style. Again, the
leaves are not so constantly opposite, and the inflorescences
are various.</p>

<p>730 species; especially in the Tropics; there are several
in America, especially <i>Lantana-species</i>; shrubby
weeds.&mdash;Many of those mentioned are <span class="allsmcap">ORNAMENTAL PLANTS</span>,
especially <i>Verbena</i>; <i>Vitex agnus castus</i> is a S.
European shrub. <i>Lippia citriodora</i> (S. Am.) etc., have
strongly-scented leaves; the Teak tree (<i>Tectona grandis</i>)
is one of the largest trees in East India, and has a very hard
wood.</p>

<p><i>Avicennia</i> is allied to this order; it inhabits the
Mangrove swamps on tropical coasts. The endosperm emerges from
the ovule, carrying the embryo with it; the embryo ultimately
bursts the endosperm and lies free in the loculus of the
fruit; this is then filled by the embryo with its large, green
cotyledons, which are borne on an already hairy or rooted stem.
The seedling thus developed falls from the tree, together with
the fruit, and strikes root in the mud. One special cell of
the endosperm at an earlier period becomes a highly-developed
organ of suction, growing into a much-branched sac, very rich in
protoplasm.</p>

<p>Order 4. <b>Labiatæ.</b> The special characteristics are: the
<i>square</i> stem, the <i>opposite leaves</i> (without stipules), the
inflorescences which are formed by <i>two double unipared scorpioid
cymes</i>, the <i>labiate</i> corolla, the 4 <i>didynamous</i>
stamens (the posterior being entirely suppressed) (Fig. <a href="#fig574">574</a>), and the
<i>4-partite schizocarp</i> with <i>nut-like fruitlets</i>. The floral

<p>They are chiefly aromatic plants (herbs, shrubs, <i>e.g.</i> Lavender,
or trees), volatile oil being formed in internal cells or in the
glandular hairs, which cover all green parts. The stem is always more
or less markedly square; the leaves are borne upon the flat sides,
and are simple and penninerved, but vary in the other characters.
The inflorescences are double unipared scorpioid cymes, which may
be situated at some distance from one another in the axils of the
foliage-leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a> <i>A</i>), but frequently when the subtending
leaves are bract-like, they are crowded into spike-like inflorescences
(<i>Lavandula</i>, <i>Mentha</i>, <i>Salvia</i>, etc.), each of
the so-called “whorls” (verticillaster, glomerulus) being a double
unipared scorpioid cyme (Fig. <a href="#fig574">574</a>). (Solitary flowers are found in
<i>e.g. Scutellaria</i>, and <i>Origanum</i>). The calyx is
strongly gamosepalous, 5-toothed, often bilabiate (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a> <i>B</i>).
The corolla is strongly bilabiate (Figs. <a href="#fig575">575</a>, <a href="#fig576">576</a>, etc.), with 2
lobes in the upper lip and 3 lobes in the under lip (an approach to
regularity occurs only when the upper lip is small, and thus resembles
one lobe, as in <i>Mentha</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig578">578</a>) and <i>Lycopus</i>, so
that the corolla approaches the 4-merous corolla of <i>Veronica</i>
and <i>Plantago</i>). The posterior stamen in the diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig574">574*</a>) is entirely suppressed; in most of the genera the posterior
lateral stamens are the smaller (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a> <i>D</i>), and are entirely
suppressed in some (see below); in others, <i>e.g. Nepeta</i>,
they are the longer. 2 stamens are found in <i>Salvia</i>,
<i>Rosmarinus</i>, <i>Lycopus</i>, etc. The two halves of the anthers
are often separated from one another, and are placed at an angle with
each other. The gynœceum has 1 style with a bifid extremity (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a>
<i>C</i>) bearing the stigma; the true bilocular ovary is divided by a
false partition-wall into 4 loculi, each with 1 erect ovule (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a>
<i>H</i>). These 4 loculi project so strongly that the ovary becomes
deeply 4-lobed with the style situated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[537]</span> the centre of the lobes
and at their base, “gynobasic” (Figs. <a href="#fig575">575</a>, <a href="#fig579">579</a>). A ring-like, often
crenate, nectary surrounds the base of the ovary (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a> <i>G</i>,
<i>H</i>). The embryo in this order, as in the <i>Verbenaceæ</i>, is
directed downwards (Fig. <a href="#fig575">575</a> <i>J</i>) (it is directed upwards in the
<i>Boraginaceæ</i>, which have an entirely similar fruit). <i>Endosperm
absent.</i></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">POLLINATION</span> is generally effected by insects,
especially bees; the under-lip is the landing-stage and the
pollen is deposited on their backs. Cross-fertilisation is
promoted by dichogamy; honey is secreted by an hypogynous disc
and collected in the corolla-tube. Some genera are homogamous
(<i>Lamium</i>, <i>Galeopsis</i>, etc.); others are dichogamous
(protandrous); a few are <i>gynodiœcious</i>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[541]</span> ♀-and ☿-flowers
in various relative sizes (<i>Glechoma hederaceum</i>,

<p>Order 5. <b>Selaginaceæ.</b> 130 species; small, most
frequently heath-like shrubs or herbs, mainly from S. Africa.
They differ from the other Nuculiferæ especially in the
bilocular, transversely-placed anthers of the 4 stamens (2
stamens divided as far as the base (?)). The ovary has 2, or by
suppression only 1 loculus, each with 1 ovule, and the fruit is
a schizocarp dividing into two, or is a 1-seeded nut. Radicle
turned upwards.&mdash;A few are ornamental plants (<i>Selago</i>,
<i>Hebenstreitia</i>).</p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Globulariaceæ.</b> 12 species; especially in the
Mediterranean. They form an analogy to the Compositæ, and in
the main resemble <i>Jasione montana</i> in appearance, the
flowers being crowded into a spherical head (hence their name)
and supported by bracts, but <i>without</i> involucre; the ovary
is <i>unilocular</i> with 1 pendulous ovule. The <i>1-seeded
nut</i> is enveloped by the persistent calyx. The corolla is
more or less labiate, the upper-lip is often absent as in the
ligulate corollas of the Astereæ; stamens 4, didynamous, with
transversely placed anthers opening by one transverse cleft.
The leaves are scattered, simple, entire, and generally form a
rosette. <i>Globularia.</i></p>

the exception of <i>Oleaceæ</i> and <i>Jasminaceæ</i> which have
<i>only</i> 2 stamens, alternating with the carpels). The gynœceum
is formed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[542]</span> 2 (nearly always median) carpels. The corolla <i>very
frequently has twisted æstivation</i> (the upper edges of the petals
being free; Fig. <a href="#fig581">581</a> <i>A</i>), and hence the individual lobes of
the corolla are oblique, but the flower as a whole is regularly
actinomorphic. A nectary, in the form of a honey-secreting ring or
glands, is often found round the base of the ovary.&mdash;The leaves, with
a few exceptions, are <i>opposite</i> and <i>without stipules</i>.
Endosperm large (Fig. <a href="#fig581">581</a> <i>C</i>), except in <i>Jasminaceæ</i> and
<i>Asclepiadaceæ</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Apocynaceæ and the Asclepiadaceæ, on account of the free
ovaries, without doubt represent a more primitive form, but the

which is 2-merous; the calyx frequently is almost polysepalous; the
corolla has distinctly twisted æstivation (the upper edges being
free) (Fig. <a href="#fig581">581</a> <i>A</i>), except <i>Menyantheæ</i>. The carpels are
<i>entirely</i> united, and most frequently form a <i>1-locular</i>
ovary with 2 <i>parietal placentæ</i> bearing many ovules (often in
several rows, Fig. <a href="#fig581">581</a> <i>D</i>, <i>F</i>). <i>Capsule</i>, 2-valved,

<p>Order 2. <b>Apocynaceæ</b> (<b>Periwinkles</b>). Trees and shrubs (also
lianes), less frequently herbs, generally <i>with latex</i>. The leaves
are opposite, simple, entire, <i>without stipules</i>; the flowers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[544]</span>
regular; corolla-lobes oblique, æstivation twisted. The stamens are
individually free, and the <i>pollen-grains are free</i> or at most
united in fours (see Asclepiadaceæ). The two carpels have 2–∞ ovules,
in all cases there is only 1 style and a capitate stigma, which towards
the base is widened out into a disc-like table (stigma-disc) abstricted
in the centre; but the carpels in most of the genera (<i>e.g.</i> those
mentioned below) are entirely separate, and the fruit consists of two
<i>follicles</i>, the seeds of which often have a tuft of <i>woolly
hairs</i> projecting from the micropyle, less frequently of two drupes.
In some other genera there is a 1-locular (provided with 2 parietal
placentæ) or a 2-locular ovary becoming a 2-valved capsule or a berry.

<p>Order 3. <b>Asclepiadaceæ.</b> A natural and easily recognised order,
closely allied to the Apocynaceæ, having, like it, frequently a
poisonous latex, opposite, single, entire leaves and fundamentally
the same floral diagram and floral structure (S5, P5, A5, G2); but in
some the æstivation of the corolla is valvate. The carpels here also
have <i>free ovaries</i>, but are united for some distance above into
a <i>large, shield-like, 5-angular head</i>, having on its underside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[545]</span>
the true stigmas, and the fruit always consists of 2 <i>follicles</i>;
seeds most frequently numerous and <i>hairy</i> at the micropyle
(“vegetable silk”); endosperm scanty.&mdash;The order is distinguished from
the Apocynaceæ and from all other plants also, except the Orchids, by
having all the pollen-grains in each of the <b>2</b> loculi of the
anthers (true 2-locular anthers) united into <i>one waxy, club-shaped
pollen-mass</i> (“pollinium”), for the purpose of pollination by
insects. These heavy masses, in order to secure pollination (as in the
case of the Orchids), must be attached to sticky discs (corpuscula);
there are 5 corpuscula, one at each of the corners of the 5-angular
stylar-head (alternating with the anthers), and to each of these are
attached 2 pollinia, one from each of the anthers situated on either
side (thus each anther gives its right pollinium to one corpusculum and
its left to another). The stamens are frequently united at the base,
and each bears on the back a variously formed, petaloid appendage,
termed a “cucullus.”</p>

which is split at its base and joined on either side with a pollinium
(this is more distinctly seen in <i>D</i> and <i>E</i>). When the foot
of the insect is caught in the slit (<i>f</i>) and is drawn upwards,
it becomes entrapped in the slit of the corpusculum, which is then
pulled out together with the pollinia firmly attached to it. In walking
over the flowers the insect will draw its foot through other slits
(<i>f</i>) and so leave the pollinia on the stigmas. <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>

<p>A peculiar relative position (and therefore a good, distinctive

cymose; it is placed <i>between</i> the two leaves of a whorl, nearer
to one than to the other. <span class="smaller">The leaf-pairs are placed obliquely in the
floral region, at acute and obtuse angles, and not at right angles (as
in the purely vegetative parts); the inflorescences are placed in two

to one another are antidromous; they are in reality terminal, each
on its own axis, and the entire floral portion of the shoot is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[546]</span> a

oil, “Sweet oil”). The best oil is extracted from the
fruit-pulp. The fruits are edible. Home: Western Asia, Eastern
Mediterranean. <span class="smcap">Timber</span>: the Ash (<i>Fr. excelsior</i>).
<span class="smcap">Officinal</span>: the Manna Ash (<i>Fr. ornus</i>), cultivated
in the Mediterranean countries for the sake of its saccharine
juice, which flows out and coagulates into “Manna.”&mdash;The
following are ornamental plants: species of <i>Ligustrum</i> and
<i>Syringa</i> (introduced in the 16th century, from S.E. Europe
and Asia), <i>Forsythia</i> (China, Japan; the large, yellow
flowers are borne on dwarf-branches with scale-like leaves,
before the opening of the foliage-leaves), <i>Chionanthus</i>.</p>

<p>Order 6. <b>Jasminaceæ.</b> The æstivation of the corolla is
<i>imbricate</i>; the <i>ovules are erect</i>; seeds almost
without endosperm; radicle directed downwards. The number
of lobes in the calyx and corolla is not 4, but <i>e.g.</i>
5, 8, 10, and variations are sometimes found in the same
individual. The fruit is a berry or capsule. Many species
are twiners, and their scattered or opposite leaves are most
frequently imparipinnate.&mdash;120 species; especially in Trop.
Asia (E. India). Some <i>Jasminum</i>-species are cultivated as
ornamental shrubs in the warmer districts on account of their
elegant foliage, and beautiful, sweet-scented flowers, the
essential oil of which is also used in perfumery; the best known
are: <i>J. sambac</i> and <i>grandiflorum</i>. <i>Nyctanthes
arbor-tristis</i> opens its sweet-scented flowers only at night
(E. India).</p>

<h4>Family 33. <b>Rubiales.</b></h4>

<p><i>The leaves are always opposite or verticillate. The flower is
epigynous</i>, ☿, 5-(or 4-) merous, with the usual sympetalous diagram;
2–5 carpels. The inflorescences are frequently dichasial. The sepals
are small, reduced to teeth, and become almost entirely suppressed
in the higher forms.&mdash;The flower is regular in <i>Rubiaceæ</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[549]</span> and
some <i>Caprifoliaceæ</i>, but in other genera of this latter order
(especially of <i>Lonicereæ</i>) it is unsymmetrical. In several
genera of the order first mentioned the loculi of the ovary contain
many ovules, but in the last the number of loculi and ovules becomes
reduced. This is to some extent connected with the nature of the fruit
which is many-seeded in most instances, namely a capsule or berry, but
in others nut-like. Endosperm is present.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The family on one side is allied to the Contortæ (not
only through the <i>Loganiaceæ</i> but also through the
<i>Apocynaceæ</i>), and may be regarded as an epigynous
continuation of this family; on the other side it is allied to
the Valerianaceæ and Dipsacaceæ. Many points of agreement with
the <i>Cornaceæ</i> and <i>Araliaceæ</i> are also found, and
in fact several Caprifoliaceæ are distinguished from these by
hardly any other feature than the gamopetalous corolla.</p>

stipules; if there are several members in the whorl, then a division of
the stipules has taken place. The proof of this theory is founded upon
the fact that not more than 2 of the leaves of the whorl ever support
buds (which, in addition, are seldom of equal vigour), and also that
the whorls do not alternate with each other, which, according to the
rules of the position of the leaves, they should do if all the members

<i>pendulous, anatropous ovule</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig593">593</a>, <a href="#fig594">594</a> <i>A</i>), the other

embryo straight, with the radicle directed <i>upwards</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inflorescences are dichasia, or unipared scorpioid cymes
with the branches developed in the axil of the second bracteole.
Both the bracteoles are generally present and frequently form
4 very regular, longitudinal rows on the branches of the
inflorescence.&mdash;5 stamens do not occur (except perhaps in
<i>Patrinia</i>). The suppression of stamens and carpels takes
place most readily on the anterior side of the flower and that
turned towards the first bracteole (<i>a</i>) (Fig. <a href="#fig593">593</a>), whose
branch is suppressed in the dichasium; after this the posterior
median stamen is next suppressed.</p>

<p>By the vegetative characters as well as by the inflorescence
and the flower, the order is allied to the Caprifoliaceæ and
especially to the Sambuceæ.</p>

<p>In the least modified (oldest) forms, <i>Patrinia</i> and
<i>Nardostachys</i>, there is an almost regular flower, a 5-merous
calyx, 4 stamens, and 3 loculi in the ovary, 2 of which however
are barren. The stamens in <i>Valerianella</i> are reduced to
3, in <i>Fedia</i> to 2 (posterior), and the calyx is less
distinctly 5-dentate; the 2 empty loculi in the ovary are still
visible. <i>Fedia</i> has a small spur at the base of the corolla.
<i>Valeriana</i> has a very reduced, hair-like calyx (pappus),
an unsymmetrical, salver-shaped corolla with a <i>sac-like</i>,
nectariferous spur at the base, 3 stamens and only 1 loculus in
the ovary (Figs. <a href="#fig594">594</a>, <a href="#fig593">593</a>). <i>Centranthus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig593">593</a>) is still
further reduced. The corolla has a spur and only 1 stamen; <span class="smaller">unipared
scorpioid cymes with 4 rows of bracteoles. In the last two genera there
is a peculiar wall in the corolla-tube, which divides it longitudinally
into two compartments (indicated by a dotted line in Fig. <a href="#fig593">593</a>), one of
which encloses the style. This wall is low in <i>Valeriana</i>, but in
<i>Centranthus</i> it reaches as far as the throat.&mdash;The rays of the
<i>pappus</i> are pinnately branched and rolled up before the ripening
of the fruit. 12–20 in number (Fig. <a href="#fig594">594</a> <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>).</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Val. officinalis</i> and others are protandrous: in the
first period the stamens project from the centre of the flower
(Fig. <a href="#fig595">595</a> <i>a</i>), the stigmas in the second (<i>b</i>) when
the stamens have become bent backwards. (<i>V. dioica</i> is

<p>Order 2. <b>Dipsacaceæ</b> (<b>Teasels</b>). Herbs with <i>opposite</i>
leaves without stipules. The flowers are situated in compact capitula
each with an involucre. A characteristic feature of the order is
that <i>each flower</i> of the capitulum has a <i>gamophyllous</i>
“<i>epicalyx</i>”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[559]</span> (Figs. <a href="#fig597">597</a>, <a href="#fig599">599</a>, <a href="#fig600">600</a>), which envelopes the inferior
ovary. The flowers (Figs. <a href="#fig599">599</a>, <a href="#fig600">600</a>) are ☿, 5-merous (S5, P5, stamens
typically 5, G<b>2</b>), but the calyx often expands at the edge into a
membrane with 5, or an indefinite number of bristles or teeth (pappus,
Figs. <a href="#fig597">597</a>, <a href="#fig600">600</a>), and the <i>zygomorphic, funnel-shaped corolla</i> is
sometimes 5-lobed and bilabiate (2/3), but most frequently 4-partite
(Fig. <a href="#fig599">599</a>), the two lobes of the upper lip coalescing into one lobe, as
in certain Labiatæ, <i>Veronica</i> and <i>Plantago</i>; the æstivation

<p><i>The stamens are never more than 4</i>, the posterior one
<i>remaining undeveloped</i>; they <i>usually have free anthers</i>
which generally project considerably (Fig. <a href="#fig599">599</a>). The ovary is
unilocular with 1 <i>pendulous</i> ovule and bears 1 <i>undivided
style</i>; fruit a nut with 1 <i>seed, containing endosperm</i> and
with the radicle turned <i>upwards</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig597">597</a>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The flowers do not always open in centripetal order, a fact
which may be observed especially in the Dipsacaceæ, in which a
zone of flowers round the centre of the capitulum opens first,
and the flowering then proceeds both upwards and downwards (Fig.
<a href="#fig598">598</a>). This has probably some connection with the fact that the
capitulum has arisen from the coalescence of several dichasial
inflorescences. In species of <i>Scabiosa</i> the flowers
open simultaneously at the circumference, or in a zone at the
centre.&mdash;The morphological explanation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[560]</span> “<i>epicalyx</i>”
is not quite certain; in all probability it is formed from two
united bracteoles, for an “epicalyx” is distinctly formed in
this way in one of the Valerianaceæ, <i>Phyllactis</i>.&mdash;The
<i>ray-flowers</i> are larger and more irregular, labiate or
ligulate, than the disc-flowers, yet not in so high a degree as
in the Compositæ.</p>
</div>

<p><b>A.</b> A scarious bract to each flower. <i>Scabiosa</i> has a
5-lobed corolla; the “epicalyx” has a dry, scarious, often finally
large collar, and the true calyx is formed of long bristles (generally
5) (Fig. <a href="#fig597">597</a>). <i>Succisa pratensis</i> (Devil’s-bit) has a 4-lobed
corolla, the collar of the “epicalyx” is herbaceous; the calyx as in
the preceding.&mdash;<i>Pterocephalus.</i>&mdash;<i>Dipsacus</i> (Teasel); large,
spiny and stiff-haired herbs with capitula, or short, thick spikes on
which both the involucral-leaves and bracts project considerably, and
are stiff and spinose (Fig. <a href="#fig598">598</a>). The “epicalyx” has short teeth, or is
almost entire. <span class="smaller">The leaves of the stem unite together in pairs, so
that shallow cups are formed round the stems in which rain-water may
collect.&mdash;<i>Cephalaria.</i>&mdash;<i>Morina</i>: the flowers are falsely
verticillate as in the Labiatæ; the calyx has 2 laterally-placed,
entire, or emarginate lobes; 2 stamens, or 2 large and 2 small ones.</span></p>

<p><b>B.</b> Bristles, but <i>no</i> true bract to each flower.
<i>Knautia</i>; the corolla is 4-partite, the calyx cup-like, with many

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination</span> is in many species effected by insects.
The honey is secreted by a ring round the base of the style.
The flowers in our native species are considerably protandrous.
Gynodiœcious flowers also occur.&mdash;150 species; especially in
the Mediterranean and the Orient; the order is not represented
in the South Sea Islands, Australia and America.&mdash;The heads of
the true Teasel (<i>Dips. fullonum</i>) are used for carding
wool, on account of the elastic bracts, which are hooked at
the point. The order has bitter properties; tanin, etc.; but
no species are used in medicine or the household.&mdash;<i>Scabiosa
atropurpurea</i>, etc., are used as ornamental plants.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Calyceraceæ.</b> This order resembles the Compositæ
in the valvate æstivation of the corolla and the more or less
united stamens, and the Dipsacaceæ in the undivided style,
pendulous ovule and endosperm. The calyx is frequently composed
of 5 distinct scales. An “epicalyx” is wanting.&mdash;20 species;
America.</p>
</div>


<h4>Family 35. <b>Campanulinæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flower is <i>epigynous</i>, perfect, with 5 sepals, 5 petals, and
5 stamens in regular alternation, and <b>3</b> (2–5) carpels. The
sepals in all cases are <i>distinct</i>, but narrow and pointed, so
that the æstivation is open. The corolla is gamopetalous with (as in
the Compositæ) <i>valvate</i>, or slightly infolded-valvate æstivation.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[561]</span> stamens are nearly always <i>situated on the torus</i> without
being united to the corolla (Figs. <a href="#fig601">601</a>, <a href="#fig604">604</a>). The anthers adhere or
unite and form a tube with introrse anthers from which the pollen is
swept out by the projecting, brush-like hairs on the style (as in the
Compositæ). The ovary is <b>3</b>-(2–5) locular, <i>many ovules</i>
in each loculus. The fruit is generally a <i>many-seeded</i> capsule
(or berry). Embryo in the centre of a fleshy <i>endosperm</i>.&mdash;The
majority are herbs with scattered leaves, without stipules. The
presence of <i>latex</i> and <i>inulin</i>, together with the
tubular formation of the anthers, the pollination, etc., indicate a
relationship with the Compositæ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Cucurbitaceæ</i> are by some authorities placed in this
family as being most closely related to the Campanulaceæ.
Although the corolla is most frequently gamopetalous, and other
similarities to the Campanulaceæ are present, yet on account
of the structure of the ovule, and for other reasons, the
Cucurbitaceæ are here placed in the Choripetalæ. The Campanulinæ
without doubt proceed upwards to the Compositæ, with which, in
addition to the occurrence of inulin and laticiferous vessels
(Cichorieæ), there are many corresponding features both in the
structural and biological relations (epigyny, valvate æstivation
of the corolla, tendency of the anthers to adhere or unite,
protandry with a stylar-brush, etc.) The inflorescence of
<i>Jasione</i> is almost identical with that of the Compositæ.</p>
</div>

<p>Order 1. <b>Campanulaceæ</b> (<b>Campanulas</b>). The flowers are
<i>regular</i> and in some only semi-epigynous, 5-merous, except in the
gynœceum which is 3-merous (the unpaired, median carpel being generally
posterior), more rarely 2–5-merous, and has a corresponding number
of stigmas and loculi in the ovary; the placentation is axile with a
large number of ovules. The median sepal is posterior. The stamens
frequently have broad, free bases (Fig. <a href="#fig601">601</a> <i>H</i>) which cover
the nectariferous upper surface of the ovary; the anthers only fit
loosely together, and become separated as soon, as the pollen is shed
(Fig. <a href="#fig601">601</a> <i>G</i>), 1 long style, which is studded by sweeping-hairs
(stylar-brush), which ultimately become invaginated; the stigmas do
not unfold until the stamens have shed the pollen (Fig. <a href="#fig601">601</a> <i>E</i>,
<i>G</i>). Fruit a capsule.&mdash;Herbs, more rarely under-shrubs or shrubs,
with latex and scattered, undivided leaves without stipules. The
inflorescence is most frequently a raceme or spike <i>with</i> terminal
flower.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Capsule opening at the side by pores and small valves:
<i>Campanula</i> (Canterbury-bell); the corolla is bell-shaped, rarely
almost rotate; capsule obconical. <span class="smaller">The pores of the capsule are
found near the top of the fruit when it is erect, and near the base
when it is pendulous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[562]</span> so that the seeds are not liberated unless the
capsule is forcibly shaken, and they are thus ejected to a considerable
distance.</span>&mdash;<i>Phyteuma</i> (Rampion) has free petals, which for a
long time adhere at the apex and form a tube round the stamens (Fig.
<a href="#fig601">601</a>); inflorescence compact, spike-like or capitate, in the latter case
resembling that of the Compositæ, and frequently with an involucre
similar to the one possessed by this order. <span class="smaller"><i>Specularia</i>
(rotate corolla, prismatic capsule), <i>Michauxia</i> (flower
8-merous).&mdash;<i>Symphyandra</i> has syngenesious anthers.</span></p>

<p><b>B.</b> Capsule with valves at the apex, loculicidal dehiscence:
<i>Jasione</i>; the petals are almost free. The anthers are united at
the base (syngenesious). The flowers are situated in capitate umbels
with involucres.&mdash;<i>Wahlenbergia</i>; <i>Platycodon</i>.</p>

<p>Order 3. <b>Lobeliaceæ</b> (<b>Lobelias</b>). This order may briefly

generally 2 carpels and an <i>inverted</i> position of the flower,
<i>i.e.</i> the median sepal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[563]</span> turned anteriorly (Fig. <a href="#fig602">602</a>)
(a position which is found to occur within the Campanulaceæ). A
twisting of the peduncle takes place even before flowering (as in the
Orchids) so that the ordinary position of the 5-merous Dicotyledons
appears to be restored. The zygomorphy of the flower is especially
present in the corolla, which has a <i>bipartite</i> under-lip and a
<i>tripartite</i> upper-lip, and is, in <i>Lobelia</i>, anteriorly
(apparently posteriorly) deeply cleft (Fig. <a href="#fig602">602</a>). There is 1 style,
but the stigma is capitate and bilobed and surrounded at its base by a
<i>whorl of hairs</i>, which assists in pollination (as a stylar-brush)
in the same manner as the sweeping-hairs in the Campanulaceæ and
Compositæ. There is <i>no terminal flower</i> in the spicate, or
racemose inflorescences.&mdash;<i>Lobelia</i> has a capsule, several others
have berries. <span class="smaller"><i>Isotoma</i> (regular flower); <i>Heterotoma</i>

<h4>Family 36. <b>Aggregatæ.</b></h4>

<p>The flowers, which are borne in “capitula” (Figs. <a href="#fig605">605</a>, <a href="#fig610">610</a>), are
<i>epigynous</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig605">605</a> <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>), <i>5-merous</i> in
the calyx, corolla and andrœcium, the corolla is <i>valvate</i> in
æstivation, with <b>2</b> carpels (S5, P5, A5, G2). The anthers
are united into a tube (syngenesious) (except <i>Ambrosieæ</i>)
which surrounds the bifid style. There is never more than <b>1</b>
<i>loculus</i> in the ovary, with <b>1</b> <i>erect</i>, anatropous
ovule. The fruit is a 1–seeded nut (cypsela), with thin pericarp, the
calyx generally persists as a tuft of hairs (<i>pappus</i>) (Fig.
<a href="#fig606">606</a>) on the summit of the fruit. Embryo <i>without endosperm</i>; the
radicle <i>directed downwards</i>.</p>

<p>Only 1 Order: Compositæ.</p>

<p>With respect to the inflorescence and the development of the individual
flowers, there is a very close resemblance to the Dipsacaceæ, which
stand on the same plane of progression as the Compositæ. But while
the latter are allied to Campanulinæ as the last stage in the
process of evolution, the Dipsacaceæ form the final stage of the
Rubiales-Dipsacales.</p>

<p>Order <b>Compositæ</b>. (For the principal characteristics compare
those of the family.) The Compositæ are chiefly herbs, but trees
and shrubs also occur in tropical countries. The leaves may be
scattered or opposite, but have no stipules. The outer leaves of
the <i>involucre</i> as a rule are barren, especially when numerous
and imbricate, while the innermost ones support the ray-flowers
of the capitulum; in a few instances all are fertile (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Tragopogon</i>, <i>Tagetes</i>). The <span class="allsmcap">CAPITULA</span> are
many-flowered, with the exception, <i>e.g.</i> of <i>Echinops</i>,
which has 1-flowered capitula (see page <a href="#Page_570">570</a>). The capitula are again
arranged in inflorescences, most frequently corymbose with centrifugal
order of development. The <i>form of the receptacle</i> is an important
character for the division of the genera (flat, convex, conical), and
also the <i>presence of scales</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[565]</span> these may be one scale (bract) for
each flower (Fig. <a href="#fig610">610</a> <i>br</i>), or a large number of bristles, which
do not each correspond to a leaf, or the receptacle may be entirely
without covering (<i>naked</i>). The flowers open in acropetal order
in each capitulum. All the flowers in a capitulum may be of the same
<i>sex</i>, and their form and colour are in that case the same, or
the sexes may be different, in which case the form and colour are also
most frequently different: the ray-flowers have projecting labiate or
ligulate corollas, while the disc-flowers have tubular corollas. As a
rule in the latter case the ♀ flowers are at the circumference, and the

<p>There is no trace of an epicalyx (in contrast to the Dipsacaceæ, which
they generally so resemble). The formation of the <span class="allsmcap">CALYX</span> is
very varied. The calyx always consists of a very small cushion-like
structure, most frequently developed later than the corolla; the 5
corners, which correspond to the 5 sepals, in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[566]</span> instances are
raised as 5 large, flat, membranous bodies, <i>e.g.</i> in species
of <i>Xeranthemum</i>, <i>Catananche</i>, <i>Sphenogyne</i>, etc.;
in other instances each of these bears a shorter or longer bristle
on its apex, followed by others in rather uncertain numbers and
with but slight indications of order, on the edge and on the outer
side of the calyx between the 5 points; in other instances, again,
the calyx is covered with bristles and hairs without any indication
of order or definite number (Fig. <a href="#fig606">606</a> <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>); finally
instances occur in which the edge is raised as a membranous collar,
irregularly toothed and notched, or divided into small scales. There
are naturally differences in the means of distribution corresponding
to the differences in structure of the calyx. The fruits <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> represented in Fig. <a href="#fig606">606</a> are distributed by the wind, those
like <i>c</i>, on the other hand, by attaching themselves to animals
and human beings. The rays of the pappus are termed <i>rough</i> when
special cells project a little beyond the surface, but if these grow
out, and are hair-like, the pappus is said to be <i>feathery</i>. In
some genera the pappus is raised on a long stalk, which is developed
from the upper part of the fruit, and termed a <i>beak</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig606">606</a>
<i>a</i>). The pappus does not attain its full development till the
ripening of the fruit, <i>i.e.</i> until it is about to be of use.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">COROLLA</span> has various forms: (<i>a</i>) <i>tubular</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig605">605</a> <i>D</i>), with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[567]</span> shorter or longer tube, not always of the
same bore throughout and especially slightly widened at the top to
form a bell-shaped opening, with 5 <i>regular</i> teeth: (<i>b</i>)
<i>labiate</i> after 2/3, <i>i.e.</i> with 2 petals in the upper
and 3 in the under lip: (<i>c</i>) <i>ligulate</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
corolla is split for a considerable distance on the posterior side
(as in the Labiate genus <i>Teucrium</i>) and prolonged into a long,
strap-like portion (Fig. <a href="#fig609">609</a> <i>A</i>), which projects upwards. A
distinction must, however, be drawn between the true and false ligulate
corolla. In the first case the corolla has 5 teeth at the apex (Fig.
<a href="#fig609">609</a> <i>A</i>) and is made up of all the petals of the corolla united
together; this is the usual condition in the <i>Ligulate-flowered</i>.
In the latter case (Fig. <a href="#fig605">605</a> <i>C</i>) the tongue has only 3 teeth
(or is more irregularly 2–3-dentate), and is only formed of 3 petals;
the corolla is then truly bilabiate, the tongue is the large under
lip, and the upper lip is very slightly developed, or even at an early
stage quite suppressed. This false “ligulate” corolla is found among
the <i>ray-flowers</i>; sometimes the upper lip is seen quite plainly,
<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Tagetes</i>, especially in the double capitula.
<span class="smaller">The <span class="allsmcap">VENATION</span> of the corolla is peculiar; there are always
commisural veins which branch dichotomously at the angles between
the teeth of the corolla, and send a branch into the edge of the two
nearest teeth. The midrib is frequently absent, but may be present,
and then it has sometimes no connection with the other veins of the
corolla.</span></p>

forms may also be found at the base of the anthers. The anthers open
introrsely, and the pollen must be carried out at the top of the tube

(Figs. <a href="#fig607">607</a>, <a href="#fig608">608</a>, <a href="#fig609">609</a>); the filaments are sometimes sensitive

as far as the apex of the branches and then converge; sometimes the
stigmatic branches are united as far as the apex. Characteristic of
the <i>Cynareæ</i>. <b>D.</b> The stylar branches are lanceolate,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>F.</b> <span class="smcap">Ambrosieæ</span>, a very reduced type of
Compositæ, differing from the others in having <i>free
anthers</i>; the capitula are generally unisexual, monœcious,
the ♂ borne in a terminal inflorescence, the ♀ in the
leaf-axils. In other respects they are most closely related to
<i>Heliantheæ</i>.&mdash;<i>Xanthium.</i> In the ♂-capitula there
are many flowers without calyx, but with tubular corolla and
free involucral leaves. In the ♀-capitula there are only 2
flowers, which are entirely destitute of both calyx and corolla;
involucral leaves 2-spined, united to form an ovoid, bilocular
envelope, each compartment containing one flower. The envelope
of involucral leaves unites with the fruits, enclosing them at
maturity with a hard covering from which numerous hook-like
spines project, assisting very greatly in the distribution of
the fruit. The whole structure thus finally becomes a 1- or
2-seeded <i>false</i> nut.&mdash;<i>Ambrosia</i>, the ♀ capitulum
1-flowered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pollination.</span> The flowers are somewhat insignificant,
but become very conspicuous owing to a number being crowded
together in one inflorescence. The corollas of the ray-flowers,
being often very large (<i>Astereæ</i>; <i>Centaurea</i>),
frequently render the capitula still more conspicuous. The
capitula display many biological phenomena similar to those
often shown by the individual flowers in other orders, e.g.
by periodically opening and closing, in which the involucral
leaves resemble the calyx in their action. (The name “Compositæ”
originates from the term “flos compositus,” composite flower).
An abundance of honey is formed, which to some extent fills
up the corolla-tube, and since insects may visit a number
of flowers in the course of a short period they are very
frequently visited, especially by butterflies and bees. The
pollination has been described on page <a href="#Page_567">567</a>. Protandry is
universal. In the bud the tips of the styles, covered by the
sweeping-hairs, lie closely enveloped by the anther-tube; in
the next stage the style grows through the tube and sweeps
out the pollen as it proceeds; ultimately the stylar branches
expand and the stigma is then prepared to receive the pollen.
In many, the sensitiveness of the filaments assists in sweeping
out the pollen at the exact moment of the insect visit.
Regular self-pollination is found <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Senecio
vulgaris</i>; wind-pollination <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Artemisia</i>
and the plants related to it.</p>

<p>This extremely natural and well-defined order is the largest
(and no doubt one of the youngest?); it embraces 10–12,000
known species (in 770 genera), or about one-tenth of all
Flowering-plants. They are distributed over the whole globe, but
are most numerous in temperate countries; the majority prefer
open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[574]</span> spaces; a smaller number are forest-forms. They abound

<h2 class="smaller">APPENDIX ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="smcap center">By M. C. POTTER.</p>


<p>The earliest systems of classification were derived from the properties
and uses of plants; and it was not until some two centuries ago
that any scientific grouping of plants was attempted. Aristotle and
Theophrastus had adopted the groups of Trees, Shrubs and Herbs as the
chief divisions of the Vegetable Kingdom, a system which persisted
and was employed by Tournefort and Ray as late as the end of the 17th
century. The arrangement by which these three divisions were separated
into smaller divisions was often founded upon a single character, such
as the formation of the corolla, the form of fruit, that of the calyx
and corolla, etc. All these systems of classification which brought
into close proximity plants distinguished by some one character alone,
could only be considered as <i>artificial</i>, since plants related to
one another would not necessarily be included in the same group. As the
knowledge of the morphology, physiology, and reproduction of plants
increased, such systems were recognised as unscientific, and it became
the aim of botanists to establish a <i>natural</i> system, founded upon
mutual relationships, which would associate together <i>only</i> those
plants which are truly allied.</p>

<p>The following are some of the chief systems of classification which
will show the gradual development of the natural system, and may be of
service to students making use of this text-book.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<p>System of <span class="smcap">John Ray</span> (1703).</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ensp;I. Herbæ.</li>
  <li class="i2">A. <span class="smcap">Imperfectæ</span> (Flowerless).</li>
  <li class="i2">B. <span class="smcap">Perfectæ</span> (Flowering).</li>
  <li class="i4"><i>Dicotyledones</i>.</li>
  <li class="i4"><i>Monocotyledones.</i></li>
  <li class="space">II. Arbores.</li>
  <li class="i2">A. <i>Monocotyledones.</i></li>
  <li class="i2">B. <i>Dicotyledones.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Ray was the first botanist who recognised the importance of the one
or two seed-leaves of the embryo, and initiated the division of the
Flowering-plants into Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[576]</span></p>


<p>System of <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> (1733).</p>

<p>In his well known artificial system Linnæus divided the Vegetable
Kingdom into twenty-four classes, based upon the number, relative
position and union of the stamens with regard to each other, and also
to the gynœceum.</p>

<p>These classes were further divided into orders, according to the
number of styles, as Monogynia, flowers with 1 style; Digynia,
with 2 styles, etc. Thus a Dock (<i>Rumex</i>), having 6 stamens
and 3 styles, would be placed in Class VI., <span class="smcap">Hexandria</span>,
and Order III., Trigynia.</p>

<p>Class XIV. was divided into two orders. Order I., Gymnospermia,
with seeds apparently naked, comprising the Labiatæ; and
Order II., Angiospermia, with the seeds enclosed in a capsule
(<i>Bartsia</i>, <i>Rhinanthus</i>).</p>

<p>Class XV. was divided into two orders: Order I., Siliculosa,
fruit a silicula (<i>Capsella</i>); and Order II., Siliquosa,
fruit a siliqua (<i>Brassica</i>).</p>

<p>Class XIX. was divided into Order I., Æqualis, all the flowers
perfect (<i>Sonchus</i>); Order II., Superflua, flowers in
the centre perfect, those at the circumference with pistils
only (seemingly superfluous), <i>e.g. Aster</i>; Order
III., Frustranea, flowers in the centre perfect, those at the
circumference neuter, <i>e.g. Centaurea</i>.</p>

<p>“Fragments” of a natural system have also come down to us from
Linnæus, who himself always recognised the imperfection of his
artificial system.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
